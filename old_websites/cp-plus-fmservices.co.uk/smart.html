				<p>Keeping up appearances isn’t easy.</p> 
				
				<p>For retail parks and shopping centres, juggling a multitude of different 
				Facility Management (FM) suppliers can present a big headache.</p> 
				
				<p>Whether you are managing your own on-site car parks and FM provision from 
				different suppliers, or a property management company subcontracting services, 
				arranging cleaning and maintenance is a complex and time-consuming business.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>Yet smart & safe common areas and walkways are very important ingredients of 
				success. Today’s consumers expect a top class shopping environment. That means 
				keeping up high standards throughout, not only in and around the outlets.</p>
				
				<img src="img/image07.jpg" alt="" class="image" />
				
				<p>Beyond that, there are crucial health and safety issues. Not dealing with these 
				matters quickly and correctly can have severe consequences for tenants and management.</p>
				
				<p>We provide a fully integrated FM service. We employ teams of trained and experienced 
				in-house personnel and, when required, we bring in the services of tried-and-tested expert 
				subcontractors.</p>
				
				<p>We ensure full quality control, employing our own cleaning and maintenance staff and, 
				if necessary, supplying on-site management. We can supply staff as and when needed, 
				either as dedicated personnel assigned to your site or as a mobile service visiting you 
				to suit your requirements. Or a mixture of the two. The choice is yours.</p>
