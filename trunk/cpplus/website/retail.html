			<h2>Car park management - retail</h2>
			<p>At CP Plus we understand the parking management needs of the retail industry and share your business 
			focus. Like you, we are in a service-based industry.</p>
			<p>Our considerable track record in managing parking at a wide variety of retail schemes gives us the 
			expertise and experience to advise on the right solutions for your business.</p>
			<p>A reliable and safe parking environment may be necessary for your operation but it is not your core 
			business - but it is ours.</p>
			<p>We appreciate that each supermarket, shopping centre and retail park has a different set of priorities 
			and we adapt our parking services to reflect those differences, either on a store-by-store or national 
			basis. We can also advise on extra revenue generation, where we feel parking assets are being 
			under-utilised.</p>
			
			<h3>Car park management</h3>
			
			<p>Car Park Management - Supermarkets - We work with you, systematically and sensitively, to provide a 
			more professional and efficiently managed parking environment. While we take steps to minimise parking 
			abuse, our emphasis is on avoiding heavy-handed enforcement measures in favour of promoting a more 
			positive approach to good parking behaviour.</p>
			<p>Car Park Management - Shopping centres and retail parks - In conjunction with our clients, we devise 
			schemes that take account of individual site needs. Where a site includes restaurants, cinemas and other 
			attractions, for example, we allow for variable and extended times and can operate redemption schemes to 
			enable clients to refund or discount the cost of parking to their customers. On communal sites, we can 
			act as a single, focal point of control, simplifying and integrating all your parking management and 
			security processes.</p>
