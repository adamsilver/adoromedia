			<h3 id="case06">CP Plus goes back to college</h3>
			
			<p>Purpose-built parking is one of the many benefits of a new building, as the staff and students of 
			Darlington College in County Durham discovered when they returned to the College for the start of a 
			new educational year.</p>
			
			<p>In August 2006, Darlington College, one of the largest Further Education colleges in the North of 
			England, moved to a new ï¿½35 million campus in Houghton Road, Darlington. The move represented a massive 
			investment in facilities and equipment for the college's 15,000 students and included a 400-space car park.</p>
			
			<p>After competitive tender, car park management specialists CP Plus won the contract to handle parking 
			facilities on the campus. The seven-year contract, which began in September, includes the management of 
			a pay-and-display charging system.</p>
			
			<p>Low parking charges were a high priority for the College, since historically parking there had been free. 
			Together, the College and CP Plus came up with a way of keeping charges low by introducing a staged tariff 
			over the seven-year period.</p>
			
			<p>The College consulted staff on their charging preferences, as Executive Director of Finance and Resources 
			Debbie Leigh explained. "We offered staff two options, a five-year agreement with higher initial charges or a 
			seven-year agreement with lower charges in the early years. Not surprisingly, the majority opted for the 
			longer-term with the lower charges during the first years."</p>
			
			<p>Staff, students and other users of College facilities pay 50p per day for parking and demand for spaces 
			is quite intensive, given the low cost and the high numbers using the site. CP Plus has introduced a secure 
			registration and pass system, to ensure that all those who park on site are bona fide users.</p>
			
			<p>"We're pleased that we were able to come up with an arrangement that enabled the College to cover its costs, 
			while keeping charges to a minimum," commented CP Plus's Paul Levene. "And we are delighted that the College had 
			sufficient confidence in us to commit to a seven year contract."</p>
			
			<p>Though it is early days, the car park has been running smoothly since the students returned in mid September,
			 thanks to good support from CP Plus, according to Debbie Leigh.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus has been excellent in ironing out one or two teething problems we encountered in the first few days. 
			They are good at keeping in regular communication with us, so we are able to discuss any potential issues and find 
			joint solutions quickly. We find them easy to work with.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus operators have also been very effective on site. From the first day, they've been showing people how 
			to put their registration numbers into the machines and helping them find spaces. The service has been very good."</p>

			<h3 id="case07">Service that has grown over the years</h3>
			
			<p>The working relationship between Heatherwood & Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust and CP Plus has come a long way since 
			1995, when the company first won the contract to manage car park facilities on the Trust's two Berkshire sites. Eleven 
			years on, CP Plus is still managing parking for the Trust and much more besides, as the close association between the 
			two organisations has developed and matured.</p>
			
			<p>Proof of the strength of their relationship was demonstrated recently, when, following a tender process, the two 
			organisations agreed a new eight-year contract, covering both security and car park management.</p>
			
			<p>Heatherwood &amp; Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust provides healthcare at its two principal hospital sites, 13 miles 
			apart, Ascot and Slough, and five other remote sites.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus and the Trust have been working together for a long time," says Kay Loudon-Bruce, Head of Security at the Trust. 
			"With each new agreement, CP Plus has won the tender following strict tendering procedures.</p>
			
			<p>"They had to convince the panel that they can fulfil all the necessary requirements, including financial considerations 
			and compliance with our specifications."</p>
			
			<p>The latest agreement includes a greatly enhanced security system, including equipping and operating a new control centre, 
			the upgrading of the CCTV system from analogue to digital, and the extension of security measures to incorporate access control, 
			integrated infant tagging and manned guarding.</p>
			
			<p>The new technology will provide 24-hour monitoring inside and outside the hospital buildings. As part of the same tender, 
			the Trust is also improving the management of its car parks by moving from 'pay and display' to 'pay on foot' systems.</p>
			
			<p>While the Trust has not suffered from unusually high levels of crime on site, improved security is a priority. This mirrors 
			general moves throughout the NHS, supported by central government, towards providing a safer environment for staff and the general 
			public.</p>
			
			<p>"We are concerned not only about crime, violence and other kinds of antisocial behaviour but also about the perception and fear 
			of such behaviour," says Kay.</p>
			
			<p>"Our aim is to reassure staff, patients and hospital visitors that they can go about their business on the site and in the public 
			areas with confidence - as well of course, as offering increased levels of deterrence and detection when problems do occur."</p>
			
			<p>Operational control and CCTV monitoring for both main sites are centralised in one location at Wexham Park. Construction of the 
			control room is now complete and the equipment installed and up and running. A total of 51 cameras now monitor both sites.</p>
			
			<p>Both CP Plus and the subcontractors who undertook the installation worked to a tight specification laid out by the Trust. There 
			are still some tasks to complete.</p>
			
			<p>"There have been a few small teething problems to work through but, all being well, we hope to roll out the complete manned 
			guarding and security system later this year." The system has been designed to be further developed and enhanced, including 
			integration, as required.</p>
			
			<p>"This has been a very new experience for us, so it was good to have CP Plus on hand to work alongside the security consultancy, 
			as part of a team," says Kay.</p>
			
			<p>Why has the relationship between Heatherwood & Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust and CP Plus been so enduring and so successful?</p>
			
			<p>"In general, we like CP Plus's approach and their hands-on management style," comments Kay. "We get on well with the directors and 
			meet with them regularly. We work well with the CP Plus manager who is on site throughout the working week, and with their other staff. 
			We find CP Plus adaptable, responsive and reliable; a good partner who deliver what is required."</p>

			<h3 id="case08">New scheme takes pain out of award-winning hospital parking</h3>
			
			<p>Hereford County Hospital has just been awarded the Park Mark award under the crime-busting Safer Parking scheme run by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). This award is the culmination of a programme of improvements to the parking facilities at the hospital.</p>

			<p>Hereford County Hospital provides services for a population of some 225.000 people in Herefordshire and surrounding counties. Officially opened in 2002, Hereford County was among the first wave of UK hospitals to be built under a private finance initiative (PFI). </p>
			
			<p>As well as Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, the PFI involved the food and facilities management services company Sodexho and the engineering and support consultancy W S Atkins, with the car parks managed by specialist parking management company, CP Plus. </p>
			
			<p>After a number of difficulties with the original parking system at the hospital - stemming mainly from its close proximity to Hereford's town centre with shoppers, workers and hospital visitors often combining visits to the hospital with shopping expeditions - the Trust Board raised concerns regarding car parking provision.</p>
			
			<p>Since it was not possible to create any further parking spaces on the site, the Trust Board set the wheels in motion to ensure that the best use was made of existing spaces.</p>
			
			<p>With parking charges at the hospital comparing favourably with other town centre facilities, the conundrum was: how to price out shoppers, workers and extended parkers without penalising genuine hospital patients and visitors?</p>
			
			<p>ï¿½We were receiving complaints from patients and visitors who would come to the hospital and not be able to find a parking space because the car parks were full," said Sodexho Business Manager Diane Weaver.</p>
			
			<p>Following the concerns expressed by the Trust Board, a great deal of research was conducted into different parking schemes around the country. 'Pay on foot' was seen by a number of Trusts to be the most efficient way of managing the spaces. This advice was backed by CP Plus, who have been managing car parking on the hospital site since 1996.</p>
			
			<p>With the agreement of the Trust, a 'pay on foot' system was introduced in July 2006."</p>
			
			<p>The aim was to tailor charges to discourage extended parking and prevent parking misuse, while ensuring they were at an acceptable level for legitimate patients and visitors.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust's three main parking areas are now barrier-controlled. Entry tickets are dispensed by pay machines and motorists pay on departure. This ensures they only pay for the length of their stay. While charges for the first hour remain as before, charges for extended parking have been significantly increased. Car park attendants are on site throughout the hours when the barrier system is in operation, to assist with charging queries and ensure efficient traffic flows.</p> 
			
			<p>To make sure the system is fair, various discounts and concessions have been introduced. For example, patients and visitors who have to stay at the hospital for extended periods through no fault of their own - for example if they have to wait for several hours in A&amp;E - are only charged for the first four hours of their stay. Frequent parkers, who have to visit the hospital several times a week, also qualify for a discount.</p> 
			
			<p>CP Plus's Gavin Povey commented, "We were asked to look at a number of issues at Hereford which we believe the new 'pay on foot' management system addresses."</p>
			
			<p>"There are many benefits. Drivers now pay only for the time they use, not the time they have prepaid. People not visiting the hospital have been discouraged from using the car park by the presence of the barrier system and our onsite operators. In addition, we have seen a very pleasing increase in the turnover of spaces and improvements in traffic flow."</p>
			
			<p>Sodexho's Diane Weaver is happy with the way the new system is working. "It's been efficient in freeing up spaces and we no longer have complaints from people who can't find anywhere to park. We're very pleased with the outcome and delighted the car park has been recognised by the Park Mark award."</p>
			
			<p>Summing up, she said, "CP Plus has been operating at the hospital for almost 11 years now. We get on well with the individuals we work with, from the operators on site through to CP Plus management. They are good at keeping us informed and liaising with the Trust on matters like penalty charges. Relations with them are very good."</p>

			<h3 id="case09">Intelligent parking solution for University</h3>
			
			<p>After an initial one-year agreement, the University of Hertfordshire has renewed its contract with car park management specialist, CP Plus, for a further year.</p> 
			
			<p>The University is based on three campuses at College Lane, de Havilland and St Albans, and is home to some 20,000 full and part-time students.</p> 
			
			<p>Lack of space and the need for consistency in the enforcement of parking regulations led the University to change its policy from clamping to fixed charge notices, outsourcing the operation. The previous parking management system, in operation for some time, was based on a combination of permit allocation and pay and display.</p>
			
			<p>"What we did was build on what was already in place," explains CP Plus's Paul Lavine. "We took the existing system and made it work for the University through good management practice.</p>
			
			<p>"We enforce it more effectively, putting our operators on site throughout the week to offer assistance to drivers and deter parking abusers, and at the newer De Havilland site, we man the barrier entry system on weekdays."</p>
			
			<p>The benefits to the University have been gradual. Parking areas are well regulated, students and staff are parking in their correct designated areas and illegal parking has been reduced to a minimum.</p> 
			
			<p>CP plus is able to help on special occasions too. "We offer the University extra support for special events like their campus tours and regular open days. We are also on hand for the graduates' awards ceremony, which is held in St Albans Cathedral and is a major event in the academic year," says Paul.</p> 
			
			<p>CP Plus has shown they can be flexible as well. "We believe it is good practice to adapt to different circumstances and to exercise discretion when situations demand it," says Paul. "With that in mind, we have learnt to be sensitive to students' parking problems during stressful periods. We tend to be more tolerant at exam times, for example."</p>

			<h3 id="case01">NHS: Finding a greener way to travel</h3>
			<p>The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust was one of the first 
			in the NHS to pioneer a Green Travel Plan. Launched in 2002 and reviewed in 
			September 2004, the Trust's plan has delivered considerable benefits to staff, 
			patients and visitors at both Bournemouth and Christchurch hospital sites and 
			achieved all the objectives originally set.</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to the plan and with the support of car park management specialist CP 
			Plus, the Trust has been able to reduce staff parking at its sites by 150 spaces, 
			despite an increase in staff numbers and the expansion of the Trust.</p>
			
			<p>Prior to implementation of the Green Transport Plan, the Trust's two sites were 
			experiencing severe problems with parking, with almost half their patients and 
			visitors arriving late for appointments because of difficulty in finding a parking 
			space. Due to the joint efforts made by the Trust's Green Transport Plan and CP 
			Plus management, this has now improved considerably - and this impetus is being 
			maintained.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust has been able to cut down on the number of single occupancy staff cars 
			coming on site, while at the same time being successful in encouraging the use by 
			staff of bikes, buses and car share schemes. The number of outpatients and visitors 
			travelling to the hospital in a car on their own has also decreased.</p>
			
			<p>Now, instead of letters of complaint from patients about the car parking situation, 
			the Trust now overwhelmingly receives letters complimenting them and CP Plus on the 
			car park arrangements. Complaints letters are minimal.</p>
			
			<p>There was some resistance to the plan at the start but gradually, by means of a 
			programme of incentives and disincentives, acceptance has grown. A hugely successful 
			annual Bike2Work week held in June 2004, during which staff were offered free breakfast 
			if they cycled to work, resulted in an immediate increase in the number of staff cycling 
			to work each day.  This event will be repeated in June this year.</p>
			
			<p>Bus and cycle maps, local transport information, cycling and car share advice, and 
			even bus tickets are available through a Car Park and Transport Office. And the Trust 
			keeps everyone well informed by means of a quarterly newsletter promoting green travel 
			and circulated to all hospital wards and departments on both sites.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus is in place to facilitate the running of the hospital car parks and penalty 
			fines are only used when justified, and not to the detriment of patients or staff.</p>
			
			<p>The parking situation at the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust has 
			eased, despite the fact that the hospitals have expanded, the numbers of patients and 
			visitors to both sites have increased and the Trust has not been able to increase its 
			parking spaces. The Trust and CP Plus will continue to work together to contain the car 
			parking situation as much as possible, to the benefit of both the patients and the staff 
			- which in itself will be a long-term project.</p>
			
			<p><a class="top" href="#content" title="Back to the top of the page">Top</a></p>

			<h3 id="case02">Moto: Driving up parking revenues</h3>
			<p>Back in 1998, Moto ran the parking facilities at its 42 UK sites in-house. 
			But they had a nagging feeling that it was neither realising the full value of 
			its parking assets nor providing its customers with the best service.</p>
			
			<p>It became obvious to Moto that, as the UK's largest provider of motorway 
			service areas, their expertise lay in providing a warm welcome for their 
			customers taking a break from their journey. In order to get the most from 
			their parking facility, they realised they needed a company whose expertise 
			was in parking. "Parking was simply not our core business," says Raymond 
			Wilson, Commercial Development Manager of Moto.</p>
			
			<p>"Every day, the general manager of a busy motorway services area has a 
			series of competing pressures to contend with - catering, retail, lodge 
			occupancy and so on.</p>
			
			<p>"Increasingly we felt that the level of attention we were able to allocate 
			to parking was not adequate. Enforcement was not up to scratch and we were not 
			able to offer customers the feeling of security and the level of care we would 
			normally like to provide. All that in addition to the important issue of lost 
			revenue; loss of focus was costing us money."</p>
			
			<p>Moto found the solution in a car park management company with equal 
			professionalism and specialisation to its own business.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus was identified as a potentially suitable specialist service provider.
			A trial run at two sites in October 1998 confirmed Moto's impression that this was 
			the company for the job. A five-year deal was signed and CP Plus' parking and 
			security management was phased in across Moto's nationwide network of sites. This 
			contract has since been extended to 20 years until 2019.</p>
			
			<p>Raymond Wilson explains: "We decided to bring in some focused expertise, from a 
			company whose sole business is parking - both from the point of view of maximising 
			our returns and protecting our image as a customer-conscious organisation."</p>
			
			<p>As revenues went up a massive 60% soon after contracting out its parking management 
			to CP Plus, it's easy to see why Moto quickly had confidence in CP Plus' abilities. 
			Moto's financial returns on parking increased substantially - and they have risen 
			year-on-year since, despite the extra cost to Moto of paying an outsourced service 
			provider.</p>
			
			<p>"To be honest, we weren't at all confident that we would show a net gain on the deal, 
			after the additional costs," Wilson confesses. "However, our parking revenues have 
			continued to grow. The biggest increase was, of course, in the first year but I'm pleased 
			to say that it has continues to improve every year since then."</p>
			
			<p>The system introduced at Moto's sites is a mixture of pay and display machines and 
			manned central parking points, supported by a team of mobile supervisors. The largest 
			part of the revenue comes from long-term car stays and overnight lorry parking. Each 
			site is individually managed, with varying regimes and hours appropriate to each one 
			agreed with Moto, within an overall operational template.</p>
			
			<p>As well as a considerable boost to its parking revenues, Moto has benefited from the 
			enhanced perception of its services that higher levels of security have brought. "After 
			dark, travelling customers find the sight of a parking operator in a fluorescent jacket 
			extremely reassuring," says Wilson.</p>
			
			<p>There have been other benefits too. Using their established relationships within the 
			transport industry, CP Plus has been able to negotiate parking contracts with a number 
			of the larger hauliers on Moto's behalf.</p>
			
			<p>Raymond Wilson concludes: "CP Plus understands the sector and we have a good working 
			relationship. We appreciate it is very important, in the highly commercialised environment 
			in which we operate, that the bottom line, in terms of parking revenue, has to be secure."</p>

			<p><a class="top" href="#content" title="Back to the top of the page">Top</a></p>

			<!--<h3 id="case03">South West Trains: End of the line for car park complaints</h3>
			<p>For many organisations, parking enforcement isn't so much about maximising revenue 
			streams as offering customers a service that is efficient, secure and - most important - 
			fair. Almost nothing annoys the parking public more than over-zealous or inconsistent 
			enforcement regimes.</p>
			
			<p>When South West Trains awarded the parking contract for its 93 stations to CP Plus, 
			it was within the context of a previous enforcement regime that had generated significant 
			numbers of complaints. Naturally, this state of affairs did nothing for the South West 
			Trains' good relationship with its customers.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus' winning of the South West Trains contract marked the start of a different 
			approach to both enforcement and revenue protection, with immediate results.</p>
			
			<p>"Complaints from passengers about enforcement are now negligible, unlike before when 
			we only clamped," explains Jo Shelley, Head of Retail Services, South West Trains. "Compliance 
			to ticket purchase is good and has been unaffected by a more customer-focused, three-stage 
			approach to car park enforcement."</p>
			
			<p>The most obvious result of the change was a dramatic drop in complaints. "A bonus and 
			abatement regime within our agreement allows for one justified complaint per four-week period. 
			But in reality we get nowhere near that number now," explains Shelley. "The same regime sets 
			out compliance to the number of station visits, response time to customer complaints and the 
			time to release wheel clamps. All these are linked to customer service and designed to ensure 
			we provide a fair and efficient car park enforcement service."</p>
			
			<p>A three-pronged approach to enforcement is key to this success. South West Trains and CP 
			Plus introduced the STEP (STaged Enforcement Policy) system, under which parking abusers are 
			issued with warning notices and then charge notices, and are only clamped as a last resort. By 
			operating a system that is based on encouraging parking abusers not to re-offend, rather than 
			focusing primarily on punishment and penalties, the STEP system is able to combine firmness 
			with fairness, keeping everyone happy.</p>
			
			<p>"Working with CP Plus to adopt a more customer-focused approach, we have been able not only 
			to improve our levels of customer satisfaction, but also save ourselves a lot of time in dealing 
			with complaints," she says. "This has freed up staff to take on other duties, while still 
			protecting our revenue streams. And, contrary to what we anticipated, compliance to ticket 
			purchase has not worsened as a result of having a fairer enforcement regime, so revenues haven't 
			suffered."</p>
			
			<p>The contract with South West Trains also includes mobile operators visiting the sites on a 
			rota basis. "Apart from enforcement, one of the other benefits is the improved perception of 
			security our passengers now have, because of the company patrols in our car parks," says Shelley.</p>
			
			<p>The partnership has worked well and the initial one-year contract with South West Trains has now 
			been extended. Summing up, Shelley comments, "CP Plus secured the contract for a second year, based 
			on their performance in year one. We've found them to be professional and responsive to requests for 
			changes. They clearly know a lot about parking enforcement."</p>

			<h3 id="case04">Safeway: A Safe Way to Park</h3>
			<p>First impressions are all important in the retail industry and no-one is more 
			aware of this than Safeway, one of the leading grocery retailers in the UK; which 
			is why it leaves the management of its customer parking to the professionals.</p>
			
			<p>With annual sales of around ï¿½9 billion, attracting something like 8 million shoppers 
			every week, it is crucial that Safeway concentrate on its core business. So, after a 10 
			year relationship with the supermarket chain, car park management expert CP Plus was 
			appointed its preferred national contractor in 2000, responsible for handling all aspects 
			of customer, visitor and staff parking.</p>
			
			<p>Gavin Povey from CP Plus said: "Safeway is very store specific and we have now built 
			up a great relationship with individual store managers to discuss their particular 
			requirements. We tailor-make a car park management scheme to suit each different site, 
			depending upon the number of customers, average basket size, how long the average customer 
			spends in the store, etc."</p>
			
			<p>Safeway management structure means that each store manager is very much in control and 
			they are the best people to set and maintain standards for their customers.</p>
			
			<p>Richard Atkins, Operational Effectiveness Manager at Safeway said: "There is a lot of 
			trust involved in our relationship with CP Plus. In fact, when a store manager is faced 
			with a car parking problem these days, we tell them to contact a CP Plus project manager 
			direct."</p>
			
			<p>Car parking can be a tricky business, from both the point of view of the customer and the 
			retailer and a badly designed or managed car park can lose revenue, customers, or both.</p>
			
			<p>It is estimated that every supermarket car parking space occupied by a non-customer loses 
			the business ï¿½200 per day and with some supermarkets losing up to 10 per cent of their spaces 
			their losses can be as much as ï¿½500,000 per year.</p>
			
			<p>Gavin Povey says: "Our research shows that shoppers who are unable to park are likely to 
			drive on to another retailer where parking is better policed. The loss of business and goodwill 
			can be significant."</p>
			
			<p>But a professional management system can prevent this, as Richard Atkins explains: "We make 
			no charge at our Aylesbury superstore car park. When we found that people were parking there 
			and walking into town to shop, CP Plus advised that we impose a one hour limit to discourage 
			non-shoppers taking spaces away from our customers.</p>
			
			<p>"Similarly at Milton Keynes, there is no charge for parking, but we now impose a two hour 
			limit to avoid a similar problem."</p>
			
			<p>Safeway's criteria for a well managed car park is that parking in no way impedes the 
			customer's shopping experience, they can arrive and leave without any hassle and they feel 
			safe.</p>
			
			<p>There are a number of different parking enforcement methods used at Safeway stores, from pay 
			and display, to barriers, security staff on site, or time limits. The best system is implemented 
			depending upon local areas of difficulty, such as the level of parking abuse, or whether the car 
			parking facilities are shared with other retailers; is the car park in the city centre, or out of 
			town?</p>
			
			<p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue and CP Plus does not believe in a heavy handed approach. 
			Gavin explains: "We prefer to emphasise the positive and to work through encouragement and

			interests, or safeguard clients' revenue streams, then we have the processes and the people 
			in place to act decisively.</p>
			
			<p>"A secure, pleasant, efficient and well-run car park is an important part of the whole shopping

			<h3 id="case05">NHS: Partnership approach makes for healthy hospital parking</h3>
			
			<p>Hospital parking needs to be managed with sensitivity and consideration. NHS trust managers 
			have the demanding task of balancing the interests of healthcare professionals, who understandably
			want convenient, secure and affordable parking when they come to work, and patients and their 
			families, who want a stress-free parking experience when they visit hospital. Yet at the same 
			time, NHS Trusts, like other public sector bodies, have a duty to ensure their assets are 
			professionally and cost-effectively run.</p>
			
			<p>North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust, one of the biggest and busiest in the UK, believes it has 
			got the balance just right. Since 1995, its parking facilities have been handled by CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>In all, the Trust employs some 6,700 staff and looks after more than 77,000 in-patients and around 
			365,000 outpatients. CP Plus won an initial five-year contract in open tender to implement and manage 
			parking facilities at their sites. Then in May 2001, following a retendering process, the company was 
			awarded an expanded car park management and security contract by the Trust.</p>
			
			<p>Since May 2001, CP Plus has provided North Staffordshire NHS Trust a ï¿½400,000 state-of-the-art CCTV 
			system and control room, funded entirely by CP Plus. The CCTV project is run on an informal Public 
			Private Partnership (PPP) basis, which enables the funding investment to be spread over the duration 
			of the contract.</p>
			
			<p>North Staffordshire NHS Trust's hospital facilities are located at four sites in the Stoke on Trent 
			area. CP Plus provides more than 30 car park staff to manage the parking facilities, with coverage 24 
			hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
			
			<p>In recent months, construction work at the Trust's largest site has tested CP Plus' resourcefulness 
			to the full. However, even with the pressure on, staff have continued to manage parking with sympathy 
			and efficiency.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus have been accommodating and adaptable," comments Alice Day, Head of Supplies at the Trust. 
			"Their staff have worked with us to manage temporary parking and help direct people to available spaces, 
			demonstrating how flexible and co-operative they are."</p>
			
			<p>For added security, the Trust's purpose-built CP Plus operated control room is linked to the police 
			via the Starnet communications system. This allows control room operators to be in direct radio contact 
			with the police. Incidents can be reported quickly, allowing for a more rapid police response.</p>
			
			<p>The CCTV system, installed in November 2001, involves substantial use of fibreoptics and consists of 
			77 cameras, covering car parks and other exterior areas. It also includes public help points, providing 
			instant contact with control room operators when needed. The system has proved to be extremely effective, 
			considerably reducing crime levels at all the sites.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust places great value on the extra security this affords. "The direct link to the police is 
			extremely important to us. It gives us a headstart if there is an incident and is very reassuring for 
			staff and patients," comments Day. All CP Plus control room operators receive police training in the 
			use of Starnet.</p>
			
			<p>For many people a visit to a hospital means an anxious time. "People want to find a parking place as 
			close as possible to the department or ward they are visiting," says Day. "We find CP Plus staff are 
			helpful and understanding, always ready to assist people if they can. We receive very few complaints on 
			parking and enforcement issues."</p>
			
			<p>In order to keep things running smoothly the Trust and CP Plus maintain frequent contact. They are 
			able to discuss strategic matters, such as staffing levels and maintaining the right balance between 
			pay and display and staff parking schemes.</p>
			
			<p>"We've been working with CP Plus for quite a long period now and have enjoyed good relations with 
			them," says Alice Day. "For us, the most important thing about the relationship is that it is very 
			much a partnership."</p>
