			<h2>Car Parking &amp; Security</h2>
			<p>As a SIA (Security Industry Authority) Approved Contractor, safety and security are among our key priorities.</p>
			<p>Well-trained and visible staff are a powerful deterrent against crime. Our on site staff and our Area 
			Managers make regular monitoring and control checks at our sites and our management and site procedures 
			are approved for the Park Mark Safer Parking Award by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).</p>
			<p>All staff receive training to NVQ and Security Industry Training Organisation (SITO) standards, as 
			well as specialist training such as aggression handling. Where required, staff will be SIA licensed.</p>
			<p>As an ISO 9001:2000 registered company, we are fully compliant with BS7499 and BS7858 manned guarding 
			and vetting procedures.</p>
			<p>In every location managed by us, we have achieved reduced levels of car crime and significantly 
			improved car park security. We recognise that safe and secure parking facilities enhance the whole 
			community, bringing benefits far beyond the obvious.</p>
			<p>Our robust security procedures form an integral part of our car park management and mobile patrol 
			services. At all times our trained staff remain in contact and are on hand to respond rapidly to any 
			situation. We can provide integrated internal and external security systems, and we employ the latest 
			that new technology can offer in terms of CCTV, vehicle logging and tracking, and other advanced security 
			systems.</p>
