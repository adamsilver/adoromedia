			<h2>Car park management for hotels, health-care, local authorities and more...</h2>
		
			<h3>Car park management - hotels &amp; leisure</h3>
			<p>Whether you are involved in the management of a hotel or restaurant chain, multiplex 
			cinema or leisure centre, stadium or any other big entertainment or leisure venue, wherever 
			you are based in the UK, we can help you with car park security and parking management.
			<a class="readMore" href="hotels.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>If parking abuse is a problem, we can bring parking control by using our proven STEP 
			(Staged Enforcement Policy) approach, combined with modern monitoring, number plate recognition 
			and tracking technologies.</p>
			<p>We can also help you make the most of your parking assets. Empty parking spaces may represent 
			wasted revenue opportunities. We can advise on ways of maximising parking usage, at times of the 
			day when your car park may be underused.</p>
			<p>For anyone in the hotel and leisure industry, managing and operating car park facilities is a 
			non-core activity. For CP Plus, Car Park Management and Car Park Security are the areas in which 
			we both specialise and excel.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park mangement - public sector</h3>
			<p>We work extensively in the public sector, most notably with local authorities and healthcare 
			professionals who are seeking to upgrade their parking facilities to provide high quality parking 
			services. 
			<a class="readMore" href="public-sector.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Many of these projects are run as Public Private Partnership (PPP) or Private Finance Initiative 
			(PFI) contracts, enabling public sector bodies to deliver improvements that represent greater value 
			for money, and without having to source the funding themselves.</p>
			<p>We see the PFI/PPP funding route as playing an increasingly important role in the public sector, 
			with the potential to offer enormous benefits. As well as bringing the skills of the private sector 
			to the provision of public services, it helps to ensure a sustainable level of investment in vital 
			public services.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park mangement - healthcare</h3>
			<p>Providing parking management in a healthcare environment means combining sympathy with strength, 
			compassion with control. 
			<a class="readMore" href="healthcare.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Our healthcare parking management schemes are designed to take account of high levels of vehicle 
			turnover, security issues and staff parking needs, while also being sensitive to the stresses and 
			strains that patients and their families may be experiencing.</p>
			<p>A shared ethos is the cornerstone of CP Plus's success in the healthcare sector. As the UK's No.1 
			Car Park Management & Security service provider to the NHS, we understand the very special needs of 
			hospital trusts and others in the sector. We work closely with healthcare professionals to ensure that 
			we provide a first class service, tailored to precise requirements.</p>
			<p>Our experience of managing and controlling over 40 NHS sites for 17 Trusts ensures that we understand 
			the importance of keeping vital road arteries clear of vehicles and have the practical skills to deal 
			with major incidents and other emergency procedures.</p>
			<p>CP Plus is able to fund both large and smaller-scale PFI/PPP projects, enabling trusts to provide 
			improved levels of service and facilities without draining valuable resources needed for healthcare, 
			while at the same time creating opportunities for them to generate revenue.</p>
			<p>As well as patient and staff parking, such schemes may cover security management, including, for 
			example, the funding, installation and implementation of tailor-made CCTV and control centre systems.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park mangement - local authorities</h3>
			<p>A local authority, is responsible for providing a huge range of services to the local community. At 
			CP Plus we are responsible for providing one kind of service - and we do that supremely well. We know 
			about operating and managing car parks. 
			<a class="readMore" href="local.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>With our help, local authorities can improve the parking services they provide, regenerate car 
			parks in need of a face-lift and please their council taxpayers - all without any capital investment. 
			What's more, they can do all these while increasing revenues and sometimes generating brand new revenue 
			streams.</p>
			<p>How is this achieved? Through the benefits of PFI/PPP projects, both large and small. Private 
			involvement in public sector projects can bring in much-needed funding, but it also adds much more. 
			With PFI/PPP, local authorities can take advantage of the full range of private sector design, 
			construction, management and commercial skills.</p>
			<p>Funding, managing and operating parking services and facilities is our business, co-ordinating 
			services for the community is yours. Together we can achieve both, to a higher standard than ever 
			before.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park management - transport</h3>
			<p>CP Plus is a market leader in the transport sector, managing parking at national motorway service 
			stations and mainline railway station parking. Since contracting out the parking management and 
			operation of their car &amp; lorry parks to us, some of the biggest names in UK transport have seen their 
			parking revenues increase substantially and their parking assets controlled and managed more 
			professionally. 
			<a class="readMore" href="transport.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Parking Management on the Road - we are No.1 managing parking at motorway service stations throughout 
			the UK on behalf of all the major service area providers. We offer similar car park management services 
			for Park and Ride schemes, both private and local authority run.</p>
			
			<h4>Road case study</h4>
			<p>Parking Management for Rail - CP Plus manages more than a hundred network sites for a major UK train 
			operating company. Our management systems allow TOCs to provide an enhanced service to their travelling 
			customers and cut down on parking abuse, while ensuring they receive maximum return on investment from 
			their parking assets. The charging, security and parking enforcement strategies we employ are designed to 
			be effective, fair and customer-friendly.</p>
			
			<h4>Rail case study</h4>
			<p>Parking Management at Airports - revenue protection and security are high priorities for airport car 
			parks. Both are areas in which we excel. CP Plus can offer increased levels of security, including regular 
			monitoring by uniformed staff, CCTV, and the latest automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology, 
			as well as a range of suitable charging and enforcement regimes.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park management - retail</h3>
			<p>At CP Plus we understand the parking management needs of the retail industry and share your business 
			focus. Like you, we are in a service-based industry. 
			<a class="readMore" href="retail.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Our considerable track record in managing parking at a wide variety of retail schemes gives us the 
			expertise and experience to advise on the right solutions for your business.</p>
			<p>Availability of parking may be necessary for your operation but it is not your core business. Parking 
			is our core business.</p>
			<p>We appreciate that each supermarket, shopping centre and retail park has a different set of priorities 
			and we adapt our parking services to reflect those differences, either on a store-by-store or national 
			basis. We can also advise on extra revenue generation, where we feel parking assets are being 
			under-utilised.</p>
			<p>Car Park Management - Supermarkets - We work with you, systematically and sensitively, to provide a 
			more professional and efficiently managed parking environment. While we take steps to minimise parking 
			abuse, our emphasis is on avoiding heavy-handed enforcement measures in favour of promoting a more 
			positive approach to good parking behaviour.</p>
			<p>Car Park Management - Shopping centres and retail parks - In conjunction with our clients, we devise 
			schemes that take account of individual site needs. Where a site includes restaurants, cinemas and other 
			attractions, for example, we allow for variable and extended times and can operate redemption schemes to 
			enable clients to refund or discount the cost of parking to their customers. On communal sites, we can 
			act as a single, focal point of control, simplifying and integrating all your parking management and 
			security processes.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park mangement - developers &amp; construction</h3>
			<p>A lot of hard work and thought goes into the development of modern car park schemes and the 
			involvement of a car park management and parking operations specialist at an early stage in the 
			project can be extremely beneficial. 
			<a class="readMore" href="developers.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>At CP Plus we like to be in at the beginning, part of the team, forming a close working relationship 
			with those responsible for designing, developing and constructing the car park. With such high levels of 
			co-operation, the result is parking management that is totally integrated into the whole development.</p>
			<p>We can help and advise on choosing the right equipment and achieving 'Secured by Design' status. Once 
			construction is complete, we have the expertise and experience to provide a first class car park operation. 
			As our track record proves, we know about operating and managing car parks.</p>
			<p>So, if you are a developer, construction company or an architect planning a new car park, don't wait 
			until it is built before you contact us. Talk to us now, to ensure the scheme you choose delivers what you 
			want, right from the start.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car park management - other sectors</h3>
			<p>You may find that the categories we mention on this website don't fit your business. However, CP Plus 
			can still help you with your car park management needs. 
			<a class="readMore" href="other.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Whatever your business, wherever you are based in the UK, whether you operate on one large car park or 
			on a number of smaller ones, we can help you manage, control and make more of your parking assets.</p>
			<p>And we're in it for the long run. At CP Plus we appreciate that car park management is not a 'here 
			today, gone tomorrow' business. It is based on providing practical services through tried-and-tested 
			processes, over the long-term. That is why we believe in forging strong and durable relationships with 
			our clients, working as two halves of a balanced partnership, to find and sustain the best solutions.</p>
			<p>Parking may be a necessary part of your operation but it is not your core business. Our core business 
			and interests lie solely in the better control, management and operation of car parks. You could say we 
			are passionate about parking.</p>-->
