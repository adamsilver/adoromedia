			<h2>NHS: Partnership approach makes for healthy hospital parking</h2>
			
			<p>Hospital parking needs to be managed with sensitivity and consideration. NHS trust managers 
			have the demanding task of balancing the interests of healthcare professionals, who understandably
			want convenient, secure and affordable parking when they come to work, and patients and their 
			families, who want a stress-free parking experience when they visit hospital. Yet at the same 
			time, NHS Trusts, like other public sector bodies, have a duty to ensure their assets are 
			professionally and cost-effectively run.</p>
			
			<p>North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust, one of the biggest and busiest in the UK, believes it has 
			got the balance just right. Since 1995, its parking facilities have been handled by CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>In all, the Trust employs some 6,700 staff and looks after more than 77,000 in-patients and around 
			365,000 outpatients. CP Plus won an initial five-year contract in open tender to implement and manage 
			parking facilities at their sites. Then in May 2001, following a retendering process, the company was 
			awarded an expanded car park management and security contract by the Trust.</p>
			
			<p>Since May 2001, CP Plus has provided North Staffordshire NHS Trust a ï¿½400,000 state-of-the-art CCTV 
			system and control room, funded entirely by CP Plus. The CCTV project is run on an informal Public 
			Private Partnership (PPP) basis, which enables the funding investment to be spread over the duration 
			of the contract.</p>
			
			<p>North Staffordshire NHS Trust's hospital facilities are located at four sites in the Stoke on Trent 
			area. CP Plus provides more than 30 car park staff to manage the parking facilities, with coverage 24 
			hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
			
			<p>In recent months, construction work at the Trust's largest site has tested CP Plus' resourcefulness 
			to the full. However, even with the pressure on, staff have continued to manage parking with sympathy 
			and efficiency.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus have been accommodating and adaptable," comments Alice Day, Head of Supplies at the Trust. 
			"Their staff have worked with us to manage temporary parking and help direct people to available spaces, 
			demonstrating how flexible and co-operative they are."</p>
			
			<p>For added security, the Trust's purpose-built CP Plus operated control room is linked to the police 
			via the Starnet communications system. This allows control room operators to be in direct radio contact 
			with the police. Incidents can be reported quickly, allowing for a more rapid police response.</p>
			
			<p>The CCTV system, installed in November 2001, involves substantial use of fibreoptics and consists of 
			77 cameras, covering car parks and other exterior areas. It also includes public help points, providing 
			instant contact with control room operators when needed. The system has proved to be extremely effective, 
			considerably reducing crime levels at all the sites.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust places great value on the extra security this affords. "The direct link to the police is 
			extremely important to us. It gives us a headstart if there is an incident and is very reassuring for 
			staff and patients," comments Day. All CP Plus control room operators receive police training in the 
			use of Starnet.</p>
			
			<p>For many people a visit to a hospital means an anxious time. "People want to find a parking place as 
			close as possible to the department or ward they are visiting," says Day. "We find CP Plus staff are 
			helpful and understanding, always ready to assist people if they can. We receive very few complaints on 
			parking and enforcement issues."</p>
			
			<p>In order to keep things running smoothly the Trust and CP Plus maintain frequent contact. They are 
			able to discuss strategic matters, such as staffing levels and maintaining the right balance between 
			pay and display and staff parking schemes.</p>
			
			<p>"We've been working with CP Plus for quite a long period now and have enjoyed good relations with 
			them," says Alice Day. "For us, the most important thing about the relationship is that it is very 
			much a partnership."</p>
