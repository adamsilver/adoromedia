			<h2>Moto: Driving up parking revenues</h2>
			<p>Back in 1998, Moto ran the parking facilities at its 42 UK sites in-house. 
			But they had a nagging feeling that it was neither realising the full value of 
			its parking assets nor providing its customers with the best service.</p>
			
			<p>It became obvious to Moto that, as the UK's largest provider of motorway 
			service areas, their expertise lay in providing a warm welcome for their 
			customers taking a break from their journey. In order to get the most from 
			their parking facility, they realised they needed a company whose expertise 
			was in parking. "Parking was simply not our core business," says Raymond 
			Wilson, Commercial Development Manager of Moto.</p>
			
			<p>"Every day, the general manager of a busy motorway services area has a 
			series of competing pressures to contend with - catering, retail, lodge 
			occupancy and so on.</p>
			
			<p>"Increasingly we felt that the level of attention we were able to allocate 
			to parking was not adequate. Enforcement was not up to scratch and we were not 
			able to offer customers the feeling of security and the level of care we would 
			normally like to provide. All that in addition to the important issue of lost 
			revenue; loss of focus was costing us money."</p>
			
			<p>Moto found the solution in a car park management company with equal 
			professionalism and specialisation to its own business.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus was identified as a potentially suitable specialist service provider.
			A trial run at two sites in October 1998 confirmed Moto's impression that this was 
			the company for the job. A five-year deal was signed and CP Plus' parking and 
			security management was phased in across Moto's nationwide network of sites. This 
			contract has since been extended to 20 years until 2019.</p>
			
			<p>Raymond Wilson explains: "We decided to bring in some focused expertise, from a 
			company whose sole business is parking - both from the point of view of maximising 
			our returns and protecting our image as a customer-conscious organisation."</p>
			
			<p>As revenues went up a massive 60% soon after contracting out its parking management 
			to CP Plus, it's easy to see why Moto quickly had confidence in CP Plus' abilities. 
			Moto's financial returns on parking increased substantially - and they have risen 
			year-on-year since, despite the extra cost to Moto of paying an outsourced service 
			provider.</p>
			
			<p>"To be honest, we weren't at all confident that we would show a net gain on the deal, 
			after the additional costs," Wilson confesses. "However, our parking revenues have 
			continued to grow. The biggest increase was, of course, in the first year but I'm pleased 
			to say that it has continues to improve every year since then."</p>
			
			<p>The system introduced at Moto's sites is a mixture of pay and display machines and 
			manned central parking points, supported by a team of mobile supervisors. The largest 
			part of the revenue comes from long-term car stays and overnight lorry parking. Each 
			site is individually managed, with varying regimes and hours appropriate to each one 
			agreed with Moto, within an overall operational template.</p>
			
			<p>As well as a considerable boost to its parking revenues, Moto has benefited from the 
			enhanced perception of its services that higher levels of security have brought. "After 
			dark, travelling customers find the sight of a parking operator in a fluorescent jacket 
			extremely reassuring," says Wilson.</p>
			
			<p>There have been other benefits too. Using their established relationships within the 
			transport industry, CP Plus has been able to negotiate parking contracts with a number 
			of the larger hauliers on Moto's behalf.</p>
			
			<p>Raymond Wilson concludes: "CP Plus understands the sector and we have a good working 
			relationship. We appreciate it is very important, in the highly commercialised environment 
			in which we operate, that the bottom line, in terms of parking revenue, has to be secure."</p>
