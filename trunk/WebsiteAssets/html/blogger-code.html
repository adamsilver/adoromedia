When I was learning JavaScript, I was lucky enough to know a friend that was a JavaScript expert. He mentored me through several little lessons, that gave me an excellent foundation. Fortunately, I made a few key notes which I plan to share here. So here is part 1.</p>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript is not the same as DOMScripting</li>
<li>Images,JavaScript, Flash, Music, Media, CSS are all forms of enhancement.</li>
<li>We use JavaScript to create client side functionality that the browser doesn't inherently provide.</li>
<li>HTML, the raw text is the default, complete fallback solution.</li>
<li>JavaScript has different levels of support and so there are two types of detection before we use JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed the above for half an hour and I thought I really understood the obvious things mentioned above, but after letting this seep through, it gave me a great basic understanding of JavaScript.</p>



<h2>
Detection</h2>
<h3>Direct</h3>
<pre class="brush: js">
var ua = useragent;
if (ua == "ie") {
    this.ie = true;
} else if (ua == "firefox") {
    this.firefox = true;
}
</pre>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>you may have to specify each browser individually</li>
<li>targetting multiple browsers is verbose</li>
<li>browser features may change between versions</li>
<li>useragent strings changes between versions</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no real advantages of doing it this way.</p>

<h3>Indirect</h3>
<pre class="brush: js">
if (this.getCurrentStyle) {
    //do this
} else if (alternative object) {
    //do this
}
</pre>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can cause repetitive code execution - hard to store the value to test in any way</li>
<li>Need to know which objects to test against</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensures that browsers cannot call methods that are unsupported</li>
<li>Browser agnostic</li>
<li>Feature/ability based detection</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of indirect detection:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">
var getComputedStyle = function() {
	if (this.currentStyle) {
		return function() {
			return this.currentStyle[property];
		}
	} else {
		return function() {
			return document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this, null).getPropertyValue(property);
		}
	}
}();
</pre>
