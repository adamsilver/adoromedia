								<h2><a href="#answerNoWinNoFee">What is no win no fee?</a></h2>
								<div class="answer" id="answerNoWinNoFee">
									<p>The No Win No Fee system was put in place in 1995 to give people access to justice, replacing legal aid. The system was developed to ensure that claimants do not have to pay a fee if they lose their claim, removing their liabilities. Here at The Accident Specialists we go one step further and ensure that you will always take home 100% of your compensation*, because if you win, your solicitors fees will be recovered from the other side on top of any compensation awarded.</p>
