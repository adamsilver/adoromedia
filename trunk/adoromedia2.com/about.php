					<h2>Our mission</h2>
					<p>Our mission is to help people and companies build successful websites. 
					We do this by helping our clients articulate their vision and by executing
					it, based on our experience in the design and development fields. We create

					<h2>Introduction to our company</h2>
					
					<p>Adoro is a team of designers, developers and strategists. The company, as it is 
					today, was founded back in 2007 by Adam Silver. The company has since worked with a 
					broad set of clients from individuals to companies, in many different market sectors.</p>
					
					<p>Our clients are mostly based in London UK (as are we). We love to work with 
					people who have a passion for what they do - if that's sounds like you
					then we'll work very well together.</p>

					<h2>Testimonial</h2>
					<p>"Adoro Media was recommended to me when I was looking for someone to turn my designs 
					into a viable, working website. I am a graphic designer by trade and had no trouble in 
					actually creating the look, feel and branding of my site. Once I had achieved this I 
					handed the designs over to Adam at Adoro Media.</p>
					<p>Although the site is relatively small I was still extremely impressed with the turnaround 
					time of the work undertaken by Adoro. I have even been set up with a Google Analytics account 
					which helps me monitor traffic to my site and study current trends. Adoro Media have helped me 
					realise my media potential and have done it all in a thoroughly professional matter, without 
					losing sight of what it actually was that I wanted. Very well done."</p>
