			<img src="img/faq-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;" />

			<p><strong>How long have PnP Decorations been established?</strong><br/>
			PnP Decorations have been established since 1990.</p>

			<p><strong>How come I have not heard of PnP Decorations before?</strong><br/>
			PnP until now have never advertised anywhere before.
			Only on our van signage and site boards. All of our customers
			come from 95% recommendations.</p>

			<p><strong>Why advertise on yell.com then?</strong><br/>
			I, myself use yell.com and I am finding that more and more
			people are turning to the internet so I felt PnP Decorations
			needed to move with peoples requirements.</p>

			<p><strong>Are PnP Decorations insured?</strong><br/>
			Yes, we are fully public liability insured.</p>

			<p><strong>What paints do PnP Decorations use?</strong><br/>
			We mostly use Dulux but if you prefer another brand we can use that.
			We also use Crown, Permoglaze, Tired Earth, Zoffany Paints, Designer Guild,
			Paint Library, Farrow &amp; Ball, Sikkens and Sadolin Stains.</p>

			<p><strong>If we need scaffolding erected on the exterior of my property what happens?</strong><br/>
			Don't worry, we have a scaffold contractor that we use and his price will be
			given direct to you to agree and pay direct.</p>

			<p><strong>Do PnP give a guarantee on any of its work?</strong><br/>
			Yes internally we give a 12 month guarantee on any blistering, peeling or any
			lifting or bubbling of wallpaper. Externally usually around 3 years using the dulux
			1,2,3 external paint system.</p>

			<p><strong>Do I have to move any furniture before the decorator arrives?</strong><br/>
			Only small items, ornaments, pictures and curtains. It would be
			helpful if you could empty bookcases or any large pieces of furniture
			so that we can move them to the middle of any large room. Don't worry if
			you cannot do all this as it is part of the service.</p>

			<p><strong>Do I, the customer need to provide any dust sheets?</strong><br/>
			No, we supply all dust sheets. If needed from your front door to the room
			we are decorating all dust sheets are replaced regularly so to keep sheets clean.</p>

			<p><strong>Do I have to be in when you are decorating?</strong><br/>
			Not necessarily. Some of our customers are landlords so don't live at the property.
			So just give us some keys and we will get on. If you are at home it will be nice as we
			can have tea and biscuits.</p>

			<p><strong>What times do you work?</strong><br/>
			Normally we start about 8-8.30am and finish about 4-4.30pm. Finish times can change if
			we need to complete something. We can also work evenings or nights or weekends if
			required.</p>

			<p><strong>How do I pay for the work?</strong><br/>
			We will issue you with an invoice at the end of the work, which you can pay then or within
			5 working days in a S.A. envelope.</p>

			<p><strong>Are PnP Decorations VAT Registered?</strong><br/>
			Yes we are</p>

			<p><strong>What if I need a plumber etc while you are here?</strong><br/>
			We have various trades-persons working along side us including a corgi registered plumber and
			a nic registered electrician that we can recommend to you.</p>

			<p><strong>Should I ring PnP for a free estimate?</strong><br/>
			Yes you should, why not.</p>
