					<h3>The Music</h3>
					
					<ol class="trackListing">
						<li><strong>Original Dixieland One-Step:</strong> A bright opener and the first of 
						nine arrangements on this CD penned for the band by Humph's trombonist 
						Pete Strange.</li>
						<li><strong>A String of Pearls:</strong> One of two Glenn Miller numbers on this album. 
						The sound of a bigger band is created by using muted brass for a full 
						sax section. For seven musicians a pretty full sound is achieved.</li>
						<li><strong>Jeepers Creepers:</strong> It's a great opener for our vocalist Jayne, with 
						a flugel-horn lead section in the first of six arrangements on this 
						recording by the band's own trombonist Simon Wyld.</li>
						<li><strong>The Entertainer:</strong> Almost our earliest offering, it dates from 1922, 
						and was popularised in the film 'The Sting' in the 70's.</li>
						<li><strong>Comes Love:</strong> A lovely minor feel in this beautiful song written in 
						1939. After the vocal, we've squeezed in a chorus for everyone in the 
						band, before the final chorus.</li>
						<li><strong>Drop Me Off In Harlem:</strong> A real 'Cotton Club' style Ellington number. 
						We play this with a slightly up-tempo feel.</li>
						<li><strong>Bei Mir Bist Du Schon:</strong> The Andrews Sisters had a massive hit with 
						this from the Yiddish musical 'I Would If I Could' in 1933. This is very 
						much our own version and features soprano sax, followed by a muted trumpet 
						and trombone duet and finally banjo. This is one of our instant dancing 
						numbers which always gets people on the floor at functions.</li>
						<li><strong>Bye Bye Blues:</strong> Originally dates from 1912 and was re-written in 1930. 
						Popularised in the 60's by the Bert Kaempfert Orchestra, and our version 
						is loosley based around that recording.</li>
						<li><strong>Whistlin' Rufus:</strong> This is a transcription of the Chris Barber version 
						of a good old tune written in 1899.</li>	
						<li><strong>Satin Doll:</strong> This number from 1953 was Ellington's first release on 
						the Capitol label and it's become a classic. Lyrics added by Johnny Mercer 
						and Billy Strayhorn in 1958 have made it something of a pop standard too.</li>
						<li><strong>Plenty-Plenty Soul:</strong> A QuincyJones/Milt Jackson number from 1957. The 
						band gives this arrangement the New York treatment and is a great contrasting 
						sound on this CD.</li>
						<li><strong>Cataract Rag:</strong> Some very tight but relaxed precision playing from the front 
						line in this 'classical style rag'.</li>
						<li><strong>Me, Myself and I:</strong> From the Billie Holiday book, this is a great arrangement 
						for our seven piece and the vocal does it justice !</li>
						<li><strong>Hard Hearted Hannah:</strong> Our version of the 'Temperance Seven' hit, and the 
						words really do tell a story.</li>
						<li><strong>Pennsylvannia 6-5000:</strong> A swing era classic. Always a popular request where 
						ever we go and once again we re-create the big band sound.</li>
						<li><strong>Tin Roof Blues:</strong> A loose busker, we play this in a relaxed Chicago style.</li>
						<li><strong>I Cried For You:</strong> Another Billie Holiday classic written in 1923. Diana Ross 
						featured this number in 'Lady Sings The Blues', the biopic of Billie Holiday.</li>
						<li><strong>Queen of the Swingers:</strong> This song was featured in it's original version by 
						Louis Prima in the sound track of 'The Jungle Book', and of course was a hit for 
						Kenny Ball. Here's a different interpretation and it's a fun number.</li>
						<li><strong>Take the 'A' Train:</strong> Adopted as the Ellington theme tune in 1941. The 'A' train 
						is the one that goes to Harlem (we really should have positioned this on the CD 
						immediately before track 6).</li>
						<li><strong>The Charleston:</strong> Perhaps the most famous of all dance crazes. Hang onto your hat!</li>
						<li><strong>My Baby Just Cares for Me:</strong> Forget the Nina Simone version of this number, this 
						arrangement is well and truly set in the thirties and really swings along.</li>
