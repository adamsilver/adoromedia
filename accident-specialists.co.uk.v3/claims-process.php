							<h2>What does the claim process involve?</h2>
						
							<ul>
							<li>You contact us and we will assess the initial information you provide.</li>
							<li>Upon review we will either take on or reject your claim and begin the claims process.</li>
							<li>We will discuss the accident circumstances in detail and note the injury that you have sustained. </li>
							<li>We will arrange a suitable time for the solicitor to contact you at your convenience.</li>
							<li>We will then pass your claim to a Solicitor.</li>
							<li>The Solicitors will discuss the claim with you in more detail and send documents that require signing.</li>
							<li>The Solicitors will then proceed with your claim.</li>
							<li>The Solicitor will send out a letter of claim to the defendant. This is to inform them of your intention to claim for compensation for the injury caused to you. </li>
							<li>You will be required to have an independent medical assessment to review your injuries.</li>
							<li>Lastly, the nominated solicitor will assess your loss of earnings and any expenses and try to recover these on your behalf.</li>
							<li>If your claim is successful, you will keep 100% of your compensation*</li>
							<li>If your claim is unsuccessful, you will not be liable for any charges**</li>
							</ul>

							<p>**Our clients are not liable for any charges should they lose a claim, however, the client is responsible to be honest regarding the nature of the accident: should the case be found out to be fraudulent then the client will incur fixed costs which are outlined in our agreement. Please call us to find out for more details.</p>
