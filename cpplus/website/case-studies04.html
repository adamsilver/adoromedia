			<h2>Safeway: A Safe Way to Park</h2>
			<p>First impressions are all important in the retail industry and no-one is more 
			aware of this than Safeway, one of the leading grocery retailers in the UK; which 
			is why it leaves the management of its customer parking to the professionals.</p>
			
			<p>With annual sales of around �9 billion, attracting something like 8 million shoppers 
			every week, it is crucial that Safeway concentrate on its core business. So, after a 10 
			year relationship with the supermarket chain, car park management expert CP Plus was 
			appointed its preferred national contractor in 2000, responsible for handling all aspects 
			of customer, visitor and staff parking.</p>
			
			<p>Gavin Povey from CP Plus said: "Safeway is very store specific and we have now built 
			up a great relationship with individual store managers to discuss their particular 
			requirements. We tailor-make a car park management scheme to suit each different site, 
			depending upon the number of customers, average basket size, how long the average customer 
			spends in the store, etc."</p>
			
			<p>Safeway management structure means that each store manager is very much in control and 
			they are the best people to set and maintain standards for their customers.</p>
			
			<p>Richard Atkins, Operational Effectiveness Manager at Safeway said: "There is a lot of 
			trust involved in our relationship with CP Plus. In fact, when a store manager is faced 
			with a car parking problem these days, we tell them to contact a CP Plus project manager 
			direct."</p>
			
			<p>Car parking can be a tricky business, from both the point of view of the customer and the 
			retailer and a badly designed or managed car park can lose revenue, customers, or both.</p>
			
			<p>It is estimated that every supermarket car parking space occupied by a non-customer loses 
			the business �200 per day and with some supermarkets losing up to 10 per cent of their spaces 
			their losses can be as much as �500,000 per year.</p>
			
			<p>Gavin Povey says: "Our research shows that shoppers who are unable to park are likely to 
			drive on to another retailer where parking is better policed. The loss of business and goodwill 
			can be significant."</p>
			
			<p>But a professional management system can prevent this, as Richard Atkins explains: "We make 
			no charge at our Aylesbury superstore car park. When we found that people were parking there 
			and walking into town to shop, CP Plus advised that we impose a one hour limit to discourage 
			non-shoppers taking spaces away from our customers.</p>
			
			<p>"Similarly at Milton Keynes, there is no charge for parking, but we now impose a two hour 
			limit to avoid a similar problem."</p>
			
			<p>Safeway's criteria for a well managed car park is that parking in no way impedes the 
			customer's shopping experience, they can arrive and leave without any hassle and they feel 
			safe.</p>
			
			<p>There are a number of different parking enforcement methods used at Safeway stores, from pay 
			and display, to barriers, security staff on site, or time limits. The best system is implemented 
			depending upon local areas of difficulty, such as the level of parking abuse, or whether the car 
			parking facilities are shared with other retailers; is the car park in the city centre, or out of 
			town?</p>
			
			<p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue and CP Plus does not believe in a heavy handed approach. 
			Gavin explains: "We prefer to emphasise the positive and to work through encouragement and 
			prevention. However, if robust enforcement is required, for instance to protect customers' 
			interests, or safeguard clients' revenue streams, then we have the processes and the people 
			in place to act decisively.</p>
			
			<p>"A secure, pleasant, efficient and well-run car park is an important part of the whole shopping 
			experience and the first impression customers get when they visit a store. These are shoppers' car 
			parks and we help our clients keep them for their customers through effective and sensitive car park 
			management and control."formation on a parking policy to suit your organisation, visit
