			<p class="breadCrumbs"><strong>You are here:</strong> <a href="index.html" title="Home page">Home</a> > <a href="case-studies.html" title="Case studies">Case studies</a> > NHS: Finding a greener way to travel</p>				
			<h2>NHS: Finding a greener way to travel</h2>
			<p>The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust was one of the first 
			in the NHS to pioneer a Green Travel Plan. Launched in 2002 and reviewed in 
			September 2004, the Trust's plan has delivered considerable benefits to staff, 
			patients and visitors at both Bournemouth and Christchurch hospital sites and 
			achieved all the objectives originally set.</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to the plan and with the support of car park management specialist CP 
			Plus, the Trust has been able to reduce staff parking at its sites by 150 spaces, 
			despite an increase in staff numbers and the expansion of the Trust.</p>
			
			<p>Prior to implementation of the Green Transport Plan, the Trust's two sites were 
			experiencing severe problems with parking, with almost half their patients and 
			visitors arriving late for appointments because of difficulty in finding a parking 
			space. Due to the joint efforts made by the Trust's Green Transport Plan and CP 
			Plus management, this has now improved considerably - and this impetus is being 
			maintained.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust has been able to cut down on the number of single occupancy staff cars 
			coming on site, while at the same time being successful in encouraging the use by 
			staff of bikes, buses and car share schemes. The number of outpatients and visitors 
			travelling to the hospital in a car on their own has also decreased.</p>
			
			<p>Now, instead of letters of complaint from patients about the car parking situation, 
			the Trust now overwhelmingly receives letters complimenting them and CP Plus on the 
			car park arrangements. Complaints letters are minimal.</p>
			
			<p>There was some resistance to the plan at the start but gradually, by means of a 
			programme of incentives and disincentives, acceptance has grown. A hugely successful 
			annual Bike2Work week held in June 2004, during which staff were offered free breakfast 
			if they cycled to work, resulted in an immediate increase in the number of staff cycling 
			to work each day.  This event will be repeated in June this year.</p>
			
			<p>Bus and cycle maps, local transport information, cycling and car share advice, and 
			even bus tickets are available through a Car Park and Transport Office. And the Trust 
			keeps everyone well informed by means of a quarterly newsletter promoting green travel 
			and circulated to all hospital wards and departments on both sites.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus is in place to facilitate the running of the hospital car parks and penalty 
			fines are only used when justified, and not to the detriment of patients or staff.</p>
			
			<p>The parking situation at the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust has 
			eased, despite the fact that the hospitals have expanded, the numbers of patients and 
			visitors to both sites have increased and the Trust has not been able to increase its 
			parking spaces. The Trust and CP Plus will continue to work together to contain the car 
			parking situation as much as possible, to the benefit of both the patients and the staff 
			- which in itself will be a long-term project.</p>
