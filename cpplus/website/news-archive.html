			<h3 id="news05_01">Where The Commuter Is King (July 2005)</h3>
			
			<p>Train operating companies face the same challenges as other organisations who provide multi-site 
			car park facilities - only more so," said Grahame Rose, Business Development Director at CP Plus. 
			"For them, as with most businesses, the top priority is keeping their customers happy."</p>
			
			<p>When commuters arrive at the station in the morning, they want fast, efficient, no fuss payment 
			and parking. When they return at night, they want to find their vehicles safe and be able to leave 
			with the minimum of delay.</p>

			<p>To enable this to happen, high volumes of traffic have to be managed efficiently within very short 
			timeframes. Unlike, for example, town centre car parks, most traffic at rail stations is tidal; the 
			great majority of cars arrive at the same time in the morning and leave at the same time in the 
			afternoon.</p>
			
			<p>As well as daily fluctuations in traffic volume, there may be seasonal ones to contend with. The 
			area served by one of CP Plus's rail clients, Wessex Trains, for example, includes a number of 
			stations in the holiday regions of Devon and Cornwall. Traffic volumes at Wessex's stations can 
			be up to 20 times higher at certain times of the year.</p>
			
			<p>Managing variable volumes of traffic at constrained entry and exit times takes a well-oiled 
			operation, well-chosen equipment, well-thought out systems and well-organised staff. CP Plus 
			works with each rail client to provide a portfolio of appropriate products and services, suited 
			to each client and each site.</p>
			
			<p>Putting the travelling customer first is obviously the top priority. All train operating companies 
			want to ensure their parking facilities are available to rail customers, not used as a source of 
			cheap and convenient parking by shoppers or local business people.</p>
			
			<p>Imposing the right style of enforcement is critical to achieving this aim. Grahame Rose said: "We 
			would always advise train operating company clients to go for customer-friendly enforcement - not 
			penalising genuine customers, while at the same time ensuring abusers don't get away with it. This 
			means taking into account the circumstances of each incident and planning for common eventualities.</p>
			
			<p>"Ideally, we strive to ensure there is minimal non-rail use of our clients' parking facilities - 
			so there is always space available for travelling customers.</p>
			
			<p>"As we prefer persuasion over penalties, we recommend operating a dual tariff system, in effect 
			pricing non-rail customers out of rail car parks and moving them on to town centre facilities
			instead."</p>
			
			<p>The idea is to target habitual and deliberate parking abusers, while allowing for regular commuters, 
			who make the occasional mistake, to be treated with understanding and sensitivity.</p>
			
			<p>"We certainly would not recommend coming down hard on a genuine commuter who fails to pay one morning 
			because he or she is late for a train. Instead we have introduced flexible systems at rail stations, 
			whereby customers can pay later in the day or when they collect their car."</p>
			
			<p>In addition, CP Plus advocates special treatment to good customers. For example, special parking bays 
			and priority parking close to the station entrance, for premium payers and season ticket holders.</p>
			
			<p>Many stations operate short-term 'pick up and drop off' points, which can be a headache and need to 
			be vigorously policed throughout the day, if they are not to be abused.</p>
			
			<p>Commuter usage also has implications for security. Unlike other kinds of car parks, station 
			facilities are unused for most of the day. Cars are sometimes left unattended for ten or more 
			hours at a time, where there are few passers-by to be aware of any vandalism and theft that may 
			occur.</p>
			
			<p>To increase security and deter criminal activity, security at rail car parks needs to be particularly 
			efficient and high-profile. Highly visible staff is still one of the most effective deterrents. CP 
			Plus operates regular patrols throughout the day, backed up by CCTV and a rapid response system.</p>
			
			<p>There are no general rules about running an efficient rail parking facility. "As in any other sector, 
			every company is different and every car park is different. We assess each one individually and 
			recommend investment, or indeed provide it, accordingly," said Grahame Rose.</p>
			
			<p>"The main thing to remember is that this is a highly customer-focused sector in which the needs of 
			the customer, as always, must come first."</p>

			<h3 id="news05_02">Parking Professionals To The Rescue (June 2005)</h3>
			<p>Parking at most hospitals and Healthcare Trusts is at an absolute premium and it is likely to be some 
			time before this situation improves.</p>
			
			<p>Yet while the Government pushes for successful hospitals to expand their services, when Trusts apply 
			to Local Authorities for planning permission for more spaces, their request is turned down on the 
			basis that they will generate too much traffic, says a frustrated Grahame Rose at car park management 
			company CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>And the fact remains that as a hospital becomes more successful, the more people want to be treated 
			there and Trusts could face the problem of increasingly overcrowded, inefficient car parking for 
			patients, visitors and staff.</p>
			
			<p>There are so many issues which face Trusts when it comes to parking and this is why a Trust should 
			look to professional advice, says Rose, hospitals should be looking after people, not car parks.</p>
			
			<p>Before installing any equipment or security systemS, there are a raft of questions to be considered, 
			for instance, what is the throughput of traffic, is the signage clear, are barriers the right 
			solution, what are the best payment and security options?</p>
			
			<p>Each site will have different requirements, says Rose, and it is therefore important to tailor the 
			parking scheme to suit each site's particular needs.</p>
			
			<p>As one of the first management companies to work in the NHS sector, CP Plus has started to see overall 
			standards improve and the reluctance to go with outside contractors is becoming a thing of the past. 
			Trusts no longer see their car parks as a piece of tarmac, says Rose, but an important resource to be 
			used in an efficient manner.</p>

			<h3 id="news05_03">Parking Abuse On The Increase (March 2005)</h3>
			
			<p>Retailers are fed up with inconsiderate motorists who make use of their free parking facilities and 
			then don't spend any money in their stores, according to the car park management company CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>"With free customer parking at such a premium, it is extremely annoying when shopping centres, retail 
			parks and factory outlets find their free spaces are being abused by rogue parkers, often local workers 
			or customers to other stores - and it's a problem that's getting worse," says CP Plus's Grahame Rose.</p>
			
			<p>"There's been a big increase in recent years. We get calls every week from retailers of all kinds 
			desperate for help in combating this kind of parking abuse. For them, every parking space that's 
			blocked by a non-spending customer is a wasted revenue opportunity."</p>
			
			<p>It's not only free parking that is affected. The abuse of disabled parking is also widespread and 
			increasing. A survey by the campaign group Baywatch revealed that more than one in five disabled 
			parking bays in supermarkets is being used by a non-disabled driver.</p>
			
			<p>Properly managed parking is an important part of the whole retail experience; it's the first 
			impression that customers get. Improving customer satisfaction and encouraging shoppers to visit 
			more often, stay longer and remain loyal are top of the hit list for any retailer - that's why it 
			is critical that retailers come down hard on persistent offenders.</p>
			
			<p>It's a complex problem that has no 'magic bullet' answer. "We suggest a range of solutions," 
			says Rose, "depending on the site, the local conditions and the type of abuse they are experiencing. 
			Each solution, or combination of solutions, has to be tailored to the circumstances."</p>
			
			<p>Deterrents can vary from simple measures, such as using windscreen flyers and clear signage and 
			putting uniformed parking officers on site, to more elaborate steps, such as using technology like 
			CCTV and number recognition equipment to identify persistent abusers.</p>
			
			<p>Sensibly applied enforcement is a solution that, surprisingly, most shoppers favour, says Rose. 
			"It's only the abusers who get upset because we've taken away their free parking. The majority of 
			genuine customers accept it as fair and reasonable and are happy that we have freed up space enabling 
			them to park easily and quickly."</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus favours a staged enforcement policy. Using this approach, the level of enforcement is 
			gradually increased over a period of time, from a polite warning note to an eventual penalty. 
			This has the effect of minimising abuse without antagonising the majority of legitimate parking 
			customers.</p>

			<h3 id="news01">Transformed Car Park Wins Award (December 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>Plymouth City Council's Mutley Plain car park has been awarded Park Mark Safer 
			Parking status. The award, made by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), 
			follows measures put in place by CP Plus, in partnership with Plymouth City Council, 
			to deter criminal activity and prevent crime. Since the site was renovated, crime 
			figures at the 287-space car park have plummeted by approximately 80%, according to 
			Devon and Cornwall Police.</p>

			<p>This is an astounding achievement for a site which nine months ago was virtually 
			derelict and a magnet for crime. The project to transform the car park from a poorly 
			used crime blackspot to a secure and driver-friendly amenity was completed under a 
			15-year Public Private Partnership (PPP) with CP Plus. The car park management 
			specialists refurbished the facility, and the company now manages and operates it 
			on behalf of the City Council.</p>
			
			<p>Mutley Plain was given the Park Mark on 17 November 2004. ACPO's Safer Parking Scheme 
			is aimed at reducing crime and the fear of crime in parking facilities. The scheme is 
			managed by the British Parking Association on behalf of ACPO, and supported by the Home 
			Office and Scottish Executive.</p>
			
			<p>The renovation work undertaken at Mutley Plain under contract with CP Plus included 
			resurfacing the car park and installing new pay and display ticket machines, entrance 
			and exit gates, additional lighting, security cameras, help points and signage. Security 
			guards now patrol the car park during the daytime. With increased security, a brighter 
			and cleaner environment and no dark corners, the anti-social behaviour that used to plague 
			the site has reduced drastically.</p>
			
			<p>David Richardson Parking Officer for Plymouth City Council explains: "Mutley Plain has 
			changed from being one of our worst car parks to a facility we can be proud of, providing 
			a high quality service to the community. In the past it was a real problem area, where 
			vehicle dumping, theft and vandalism were rife. Some of the levels were almost empty, not 
			being used by drivers because they were so afraid to park there.</p>
			
			<p>"Now, crime levels have significantly reduced, to the extent that we've only had a couple of 
			cases reported in the last nine months. It is a terrific transformation."</p>
			
			<p>The new-look car park is on three levels, each accommodating 100 vehicles and catering for 
			different parking needs. The first level is pay and display short-term parking. The middle 
			level is let to Plymouth University, just ten minutes' walk away. The third and lowest level 
			is a totally secure, barrier- and CCTV-protected area designed for longer stays with mainly 
			season ticket usage; these spaces are mainly used by local residents and workers.</p>
			
			<p>Commenting on the Mutley Plain car park project, Councillor Sue Dann, Portfolio Holder for 
			Transport and Customer Focus, says, "This is part of a wider strategy of the Council to improve 
			our car parks and make car parks a safer place for users."</p>
			
			<p>Summing up, David Richardson says: "We are delighted with the improvements that have been carried 
			out, which are of great benefit to residents and shoppers, who are once again able to use this 
			facility in the knowledge that the car park is a safer place to park."</p>

			<h3 id="news02">A Professional Partnership (November 2004)</h3>

			<p>A partnership to develop major urban car parking sites across the UK has been formed between CP 
			Plus and The Raven Group. CP Plus, founded in 1991, is the UK's fastest growing car park management 
			and security company, managing and operating more than 450 car park sites. It is the UK's number one 
			provider to the NHS and motorway services areas with an additional strong presence in the rail and 
			supermarket sectors.</p>
			
			<p>Complementing CP Plus' expertise is The Raven Group's reputation as a successful commercial property 
			developer. Set up 12 years ago, the Group has accrued a broad based project portfolio which spans the 
			retail, supermarket, office and hotel sectors.</p>
			
			<p>Grahame Rose of CP Plus said: "We believe that there is a large number of surface and Multi-Storey 
			Car Parks (MSCP) either in disrepair or that with innovation could provide both parking and other 
			community needs. To repair or upgrade parking facilities will normally require considerable funding.</p>
			
			<p>"We have set up CP Raven to provide the design and all the funding required to develop, repair, 
			renovate, upgrade and return vastly improved structures and parking facilities to the communities 
			across the UK."</p>
			
			<p>The multi-disciplinary approach of the new partnership will lead to the provision of multi-use 
			property developments combining retail, leisure, office and parking facilities, using the expertise 
			of both parties.</p>
			
			<p>"Imaginative, modern schemes can breathe life into an area, at the same time generating new revenue 
			sources," says Anton Bilton of The Raven Group. "We've built a reputation for working hard and playing 
			straight, and have joined forces with CP Plus as we believe they share the same values."</p>

			<h3 id="news03">Professional Parking Care For Hospital Trust (September 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>CP Plus has signed a contract to manage the parking at the two hospitals in the Shrewsbury and Telford 
			Hospital NHS Trust.</p>

			<p>The Royal Shrewsbury in Shrewsbury and the Princess Royal in Telford were merged into one Trust in October 
			2003, to serve the needs of communities in Shropshire and mid-Wales. Though both are large district general 
			hospitals, the parking issues they face are quite different.</p>
			
			<p>Following the merger, the Trust decided to bring consistency to the management of parking on both sites, 
			replacing and upgrading the different in-house systems that prevailed in the past.</p>
			
			<p>"We realised we needed to bring in a professional contractor to manage traffic and car parking for us, in 
			order to improve the service for staff, patients and visitors," explains Andy Hudson, Project Manager for 
			the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. A tendering and presentation process, in line with European 
			Union regulations, resulted in CP Plus winning the 10-year management contract, which runs from October at 
			Shrewsbury and November at Telford.</p>
			
			<p>"The evaluation and procurement team were impressed with CP Plus's professional approach, and their understanding 
			of the needs of providing car park management in the healthcare environment," comments Andy. One of the car park 
			management company's first acts was to introduce a trust-wide car parking policy to tackle the triple issues of 
			congestion, enforcement and lack of parking spaces that afflicted both sites, as they do at many UK hospital trusts.</p>
			
			<p>"Our priorities are to keep traffic moving on site and to get people to park in the designated areas," says Andy. 
			Both congestion and inconsiderate parking were problems under the hospitals' previous parking regimes. At the Royal 
			Shrewsbury they relied on an outdated, pay-on-exit barrier system, managed and enforced in-house. "We had problems 
			in regard to people not adhering to the rules and regulations," Andy admits.</p>
			
			<p>"Like many hospitals, we have a fair amount of development going on, which reduces the car park spaces available. 
			As a result, people were parking on grass verges, along access roads and all over the place. Clearly, something 
			had to be done to deal with this."</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus's solution was to upgrade the car parking on site. The company has introduced a pay-and-display system for 
			patients and visitors, and a managed permit scheme for hospital staff. The 13 pay-and-display machines installed 
			include an advanced innovation - alphanumeric keyboards. Drivers type in their vehicle's registration number when 
			parking, eliminating the problem of ticket transfer and increasing efficiency.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, CP Plus operators are on site during extended hours to manage the running and ensure compliance. CP 
			Plus has also reformatted the car park to provide optimum space allocation and dedicated areas for patients and 
			visitors, and staff.</p>
			
			<p>At the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, it was - in Andy Hudson's own words - "a whole new ball game." No
			charges at all have been made for parking in the past and CP Plus is assisting the Trust on the introduction 
			of parking charges for the first time at the site. Eleven pay and display machines have been installed, the car 
			parks reformatted to optimise space and an extra 70 new staff spaces constructed.</p>
			
			<p>Introducing change on this scale inevitably cause ripples, as Andy Hudson explains: "CP Plus staff have been 
			very professional and helpful throughout the implementation. No-one likes change and CP Plus has been helping
			us to manage the change process as smoothly as possible, and help staff, in particular, to come to terms with the 
			new arrangements. "No doubt there will be further issues to address as the contract moves on. We look forward to 
			working with CP Plus on dealing with them."</p>

			<h3 id="news04">New Scheme To Improve Parking Safety (August 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>Pressure from the parking industry has forced a rethink on car park safety. Following complaints from car park 
			operators of unrealistic expectations, the Government and police have overhauled the 'Secured Parking Scheme', set 
			up in 1992.</p>

			<p>This has now been replaced with the 'Safer Parking Scheme', to be launched to the public in October under the supervision 
			of the British Parking Association (BPA) on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).</p>
			
			<p>Grahame Rose of CP Plus is optimistic that the new scheme will fare better than the first, he says: "Only 1400 car parks 
			signed up for the Secured Parking Scheme, probably because it was largely 'design' led. This is fine when building a new 
			car park, but most existing car parks could never comply with the regulations without incurring prohibitive refurbishment 
			costs which would only bump up parking costs to the parking public.</p>
			
			<p>"The difference with the new scheme is that it is 'risk' led and taken that this is a voluntary scheme, it is much more 
			likely to gain the support of the parking industry."</p>
			
			<p>Operators will be required to focus on 'reducing risk' rather than being forced to make design improvements. This could 
			include installing security systems, such as CCTV and panic buttons or adopting sensible practices such as vandal-proof 
			lighting and staff patrols to ensure maximum customer safety.</p>
			
			<p>Car crime accounts for a fifth of all offences, and 22% of this occurs in car parks, so police are urging the industry to 
			pull together to drive criminals out of car parks. A criticism of the previous 'Secured Car Parks Scheme' was that the word 
			'secured' wrongly implied that an area had been made entirely crime free.</p>
			
			<p>Deputy Chief Constable Bob Quick of ACPO says: "I am confident that the new scheme will allow all car park operators the 
			opportunity to fulfil the criteria that will be recognised with the highly valued status." At the same time the BPA has 
			promised to improve training of its regional inspection teams after criticism from the industry that the rules were not 
			consistently applied.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus will be looking to put all car parks under their management forward for accreditation in the new scheme.</p>

			<h3 id="news05">Safety Of Women In Car Parks (July 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>The safety of anyone in a car park, whether it is a customer or member of staff, male or female, should be a top 
			priority for any operator, says Grahame Rose of car park management company CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>"Crimes committed against women understandably receive a lot of publicity through the media which raises their fear 
			of attack, particularly when they are on their own. However, these crimes don't receive publicity because they're 
			happening every day, they receive publicity because they rarely occur. However, it is the duty of the car park 
			operator to reassure its female customers and provide them with every safety precaution available to the industry 
			in order to protect them.</p>
			
			<p>"Of course it is easier when building a brand new car park to use glass and transparent materials, avoid the use of 
			large pillars which provide hiding places for criminals and have bright state-of-the-art security lighting to avoid 
			any dark corners. But in many cases we are talking about existing car parks where the cost of refurbishment would be 
			prohibitive without imposing unrealistic increases in parking fees on the customer."</p>
			
			<p>But that doesn't mean to say there are not many security measures which can be introduced to make existing car parks 
			as safe as possible for women, and here CP Plus provides some useful advice:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Women-only parking spaces can be made available, situated close to pedestrian exits.</li>
   			<li>All lighting should be regularly checked and any broken light bulbs replaced or faults reported immediately. Install vandal-proof lighting to keep breakages to a minimum.</li>
    		<li>Night time security staff on patrol around a car park can help to deter would-be troublemakers and make women feel safer. Staff could be responsible for walking a women to her car.</li>
    		<li>Install security systems, such as CCTV and panic buttons. These measures can all act as a deterrent to would-be attackers and give reassurance to women parking alone.</li>
    		<li>Where landscaping is relevant, all plants should be slow growing and low level so as not to impede security.</li>
    		<li>Make entry and exit signage as clear as possible for both pedestrians and drivers, so as not to panic women who may be nervous finding a space or finding the exit on their own.</li>
    		<li>Keep your car park clean and tidy, although this may not appear to directly relate to security, it will make customers feel more confident and want to park there. A dirty, rubbish-strewn car park is more likely to attract anti-social behaviour.</li>
   			<li>Register your car park under the newly revised 'Safer Parking Scheme', supervised by the British Parking Association (BPA) on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). This will help you to provide the highest standard of safety for all your customers.</li>

			<p>Wessex Trains, which operates train services from Penzance to Gloucester and Cardiff to 
			Brighton, has appointed car park management expert CP Plus to oversee a step change in the 
			service provided at its 22 paying car parks throughout the South West.</p>

			<p>Although the company had an existing contractor in place to cover its commuter car parks, 
			this was largely a clamping operation put in place to administer the nuts and bolts of ticketing 
			machines. Jeremy Whitaker, Commercial Director explains: "The level of enforcement had become 
			very low, parking bays were not clearly defined, signage had not been brought up to date and 
			the standard of cleanliness was generally poor.</p>
			
			<p>"Although we had no real customer complaints, due to lack of management we did not feel we were 
			giving the impression of a 21st century car park. Prices had not changed to reflect local 
			circumstances for a number of years and coupled with the rather 'down at heel' appearance, 
			we decided it was time to smarten up."</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus won the contract following a robust competitive tender process. Jeremy Whitaker said: 
			"We awarded CP Plus the contract as we were particularly impressed by their staffing cover and 
			flexibility of their service.</p>
			
			<p>"Our contract with them allows for daily staffed visits to our paying locations but will also 
			include visits to some of our non-paying car parks, which in some cases have a high level of 
			abuse of parking regulations. At these locations, CP Plus will advise whether a charging system 
			would improve the situation."</p>
			
			<p>First impressions are important, which is why CP Plus plans to replace signage, refurbish the pay 
			and display machines where necessary and paint new white lines to define parking areas, paying 
			particular attention to disabled bays. Cleanliness problems will be improved by a daily litter 
			pick.</p>
			
			<p>The implementation of a structured car park management scheme not only improves services to customers 
			but can significantly increase revenue. CP Plus' Grahame Rose says: "A secure, pleasant and well-run 
			car park is an important part of the whole commuting experience. A good parking policy lays down the 
			principles that will ensure customers are provided with facilities that meet their needs, gives them 
			peace of mind and encourage them to return."</p>
			
			<p>Uniformed staff help towards improved security, as well as provide an important customer facing role.
			All CP Plus staff are vetted and receive a comprehensive training and on-going assessment programme.</p>
			
			<p>Wessex Trains acknowledge that they will benefit from the services CP Plus bring and recognise that safe 
			and secure parking facilities can only benefit the community in their service areas.</p>
			
			<p>Jeremy Whitaker summarises: "It was clear that CP Plus had understood the needs of our business, which 
			has a franchise extension through to March 2006, by coming up with a pragmatic pricing structure which 
			recognised the need to make improvements within our cost limitations.</p>
			
			<p>"They also showed they were able to adapt to seasonal changes we experience on our Portsmouth route which 
			serves Cardiff and the Millennium Stadium and in Devon and Cornwall, where customer volumes can be 20 times 
			higher in the summer.</p>
			
			<p>"This is about putting in management with a capital 'M', management by professionals, which is long overdue."</p>
			
			<p>The car park management contract will start mid-May and run initially for two years.</p>

			<p>Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust and car park management specialist, CP Plus, are working together to find a cure 
			for longstanding access and congestion problems at the Trust's biggest site.</p>
			
			<p>Under a three-year contract, on 1 May CP Plus took over management of the 2000-space car parks at the Royal Cornwall 
			Hospital in Truro, the largest of 13 sites within the Trust.</p>
			
			<p>Like many NHS Trusts, the Royal Cornwall has been experiencing parking problems for a number of years. Access to and 
			from the site is difficult and the parking provision is constantly hard-pressed. At peak times, parking abuse can lead 
			to badly parked vehicles blocking access roads and, with spaces at a premium during these periods, hospital staff often 
			use public parking areas, causing problems for visitors and patients.</p>
			
			<p>Judith Rowe, Site Services Manager at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, takes up the story. "The problems of accessibility 
			onto the site and, once on site, problems of congestion have been a source of frustration to everyone working here or 
			visiting."</p>
			
			<p>A mixture of pay-and-display and pay-on-exit schemes introduced some time ago has failed to get to the root of the 
			problems. So when the car park management contract at the Royal Cornwall came up for renewal, it seemed the perfect 
			opportunity for the Trust to grasp the nettle and solve these issues.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus, with its extensive experience of car park management in the NHS and other sectors, was one of a number of 
			companies who tendered for the work.</p>
			
			<p>"The Trust went through a robust procurement process - and CP Plus came out on top," says Judith. "We used a scoring 
			system, with tendering companies marked against three areas - value for money, technical and operational ability, 
			safety and security.</p>
			
			<p>"CP Plus scored highest in all three. They came out as offering good value for money being forward thinking, innovative 
			and pro-active. They impressed us as being ready to move forward with us and work with us - that came over very strongly 
			- with good communications very much being the key."</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus is currently in discussion with the Trust to develop and implement a new parking management scheme for the site, 
			which will include new signage and machines. The introduction of a new parking policy and more effective enforcement 
			procedures is high on the agenda, as is the Trust's commitment to support staff in using alternative forms of transport.</p>
			
			<p>The process of establishing good communications has got off to a good start already, as Judith Rowe explains: "CP Plus 
			tells us that efficient management and enforcement are the key to solving our on site problems. We've met their team and 
			are very much looking forward to working with them on improving our parking services - and getting this site back on track."</p>

			<p>Commuters rely every day on an efficient car parking system that will allow them to park with the minimum of fuss and 
			ensure the safety of their car while they are away all day.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus has been managing 93 station car parks for South West Trains for the past 2_years in an arrangement which has 
			worked so well that they have now been awarded the contract for a further 3 years.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus operates a three-pronged approach to enforcement in the South West Trains car parks called the STEP (Staged 
			Enforcement Policy) system, under which parking abusers are issued with warning notices and then charge notices, and 
			are only clamped as a last resort. This has dramatically reduced the number of customer complaints and increased 
			compliance to ticket purchase.</p>
			
			<p>Jo Shelley from South West Trains says: "Operating a customer-focused service alongside a system which protects our 
			revenue streams has proved extremely successful. We are more than satisfied with the level of service provided by CP 
			Plus and look forward to our continued working relationship with them."</p>

			<h3 id="news09">Solving Parking Problems Today And Tomorrow (March 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>Within a month of appointing CP Plus in February 2004 to manage its car parks, most of the parking problems experienced 
			by the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Trust were eased. Within the next year, the construction of a �3.5 
			million multi-storey car park facility, also being developed by CP Plus, will solve the Trust's problems for the foreseeable 
			future.</p>
			
			<p>As John Cawood, Estates and Capital Manager, Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Trust explains, parking issues 
			at the Trust's two sites required two different approaches: tactical, to ease the immediate situation and strategic, to deal 
			with longer-term demands on the service.</p>
			
			<p>Following a tendering and interview process, CP Plus was selected to help with both the interim and long-term solutions. The 
			Trust chose CP Plus because it believed the contractor offered the best choice of services across the board, with extensive 
			experience in both car park management and new-build development, in the NHS and other sectors.</p>
			
			<p>The Trust's two sites at Bournemouth and Christchurch are just two miles apart. Under the existing arrangements, Bournemouth 
			has 945 staff and 425 pay and display spaces; the smaller Christchurch site has 193 staff and 121 pay and display places. "As 
			hospital targets have increased and the numbers of patients treated have risen, we get more and more visitors, who require 
			more parking spaces," John continues. "Just about all hospitals in the UK have come under pressure like this, the Trust is not 
			unusual in this respect. We simply don't have sufficient parking."</p>
			
			<p>It was decided that a new-build facility was the only long-term answer. As well as providing 700 additional parking spaces, 
			the multi-storey construction will release land currently used for surface parking, making more flexible use of the site. If 
			all approvals are met, to finance the new development the Trust will enter into a 25-year Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
			agreement with CP Plus. Under the terms of the contract, CP Plus will provide the capital for the development and construction 
			of the car park.</p>
			
			<p>Income generated from staff and patient parking charges will pay for the capital development, over the contract period. Once 
			planning permission has been granted, it will take about a year for the new facility to be built. In the meantime, however, 
			parking is still a problem at the Bournemouth and Christchurch hospitals. Clearly something needed to be done urgently. CP Plus 
			was asked to provide an interim car park management solution to 'ease the squeeze'.</p>
			
			<p>The results of the new parking management regime were almost immediate. "Within a month, CP Plus had already achieved some the 
			objectives set for them, in terms of improving the management of the car parks," says John. "We're now able to provide a better 
			service to our staff, patients and visitors. Naturally, we're very pleased."</p>
			
			<p>"Our main management problem was that we didn't have enough parking for staff on site at the right times and in the right places. 
			CP Plus got to the bottom of that straightaway, putting operators on site to deal with the situation. They've made all the 
			difference � and they have the right attitude. They are there to help and not to upset people, yet they have a firm hand when 
			it's needed."</p>
			
			<p>The Trust has been pioneering other methods of easing parking problems too. Since 2003 it has been running a Green Travel Plan 
			scheme. In that time significant numbers of staff have been persuaded to cycle to work, share their cars, or make use of an 
			off-site park and ride service. To date, more than 125 members of staff have given up their parking permits and found a greener 
			way to travel to work. "The scheme is very successful," says John, "more successful than we thought, overachieving the targets
			we set." The Green Travel Plan will continue, providing a complementary service alongside the new multi-storey.</p>
			
			<p>Summing up John, says, "CP Plus have been very helpful and there have been no problems so far. They are currently monitoring 
			the sites for us. So we will soon have further very useful information on our busy times and flat periods, which will help us 
			plan still further. "The interim arrangement being run by CP Plus for us is easing our parking problems for the time being and 
			the multi-storey will, we hope, solve the issue more permanently."</p>

			<h3 id="news10">Don't Stop 'Til You Shop (February 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>CP Plus is helping retail clients enforce a 'Don't stop unless you shop' policy aimed at discouraging commuters and office 
			workers from occupying shoppers' parking spaces.</p>
			
			<p>It is estimated that every supermarket car parking space occupied by a non-customer loses the business �200 per day and with 
			some supermarkets losing up to 10 per cent of their spaces the losses can be as much as �500,000 per year.</p>
			
			<p>Comments Grahame Rose: "The problem is escalating for supermarkets. Our research shows that shoppers who are unable to park are 
			likely to drive on to another retailer where parking is better policed. The loss of business and goodwill can be significant."</p>
			
			<p>He says supermarkets who suffer most tend to be those in town centres where their car parks are seen as a free for all; those 
			near office developments which are abused by local workers and those near train and coach stations which are packed out with 
			commuters.</p>
			
			<p>"Car parking generally is becoming harder to find and more expensive and drivers will try and get away without paying if they can. 
			That is why we are working with an increasing number of retailers to drive home the 'Don't stop til you shop' message to non-customers.</p>
			
			<p>"A secure, pleasant, efficient and well-run car park is an important part of the whole shopping experience and the first impression 
			customers get when they visit a store. These are shoppers car parks and we help our clients to keep them for shoppers through 
			effective and sensitive car park management and control."</p>

			<h3 id="news11">Can't Catch TV (January 2004)</h3>
			
			<p>Car park owners and operators are placing too much faith in CCTV in the fight against crime, according to car park management company, 
			CP Plus' Ian Langdon.</p>
			
			<p>He points out that CCTV can be found everywhere in our towns and cities from shops to swimming pools, cashpoints to car parks and as a 
			result is losing its effectiveness as a deterrent, particularly in the battle against petty crime.</p>
			
			<p>Says Langdon: "When CCTV first started appearing it deterred thieves and vandals but that is often no longer the case. It is often a 
			reactive rather than pro-active solution when it is used after someone has vandalised or broken into your car.</p>
			
			<p>"And petty thieves know that the police are far too over-stretched to spend hours watching CCTV footage trying to identify culprits who 
			have committed minor crime.</p>
			
			<p>"CCTV in car parks or anywhere else, can be highly beneficial when serious crimes are committed but in the cases of small time thefts and 
			vandalism it really is Can't Catch TV."</p>
			
			<p>He says that instead of seeing CCTV as the only form of protection for their car park, managers and operators should regard it as just one 
			of the weapons in their armoury.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus believes that CCTV is only effective when complemented by manned patrols on site. If an offender is seen acting suspiciously staff 
			are immediately on hand to prevent a crime being committed and even if culprits are only seen after an offence has occurred, they are still 
			likely to be apprehended before they leave the site.</p>
			
			<p>Langdon's stance is supported by Home Office's Secured Car Parks Scheme, which states that effective surveillance should comprise both CCTV 
			and human presence with random foot patrols.Other recommendations are: secure boundaries with minimal pedestrian access routes; good lighting, 
			integrated long and short stay areas, minimal foliage and areas of concealment and effective barriers.</p>
			
			<p>Home Office statistics reveal that 40% of all day time thefts from cars take place in public car parks but currently only about 7% of car 
			parks are signed up to the Secured Car Parks Scheme. On average car parks see a 70% reduction in crime following Secured Status.</p>

			<h3 id="news12">Welcoming A Professional Approach (October 2003)</h3>
			
			<p>The major UK motorway services provider, Welcome Break, has recently signed a five-year contract with CP Plus to manage car parking at 
			its 22 sites. The deal is part of a move by Welcome Break to improve its services to both car drivers and HGV customers.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus is a market leader in the transport sector, managing railway station parking as well as national motorway service stations.</p>
			
			<p>"We decided to go ahead with CP Plus because they understand the market and can manage our parking facilities more efficiently than we can -
			their track record shows that. This leaves us to focus on what we do best, providing places for our customers to relax, eat and drink," 
			says Karen McKechnie, Welcome Break Business Development Director.</p>
			
			<p>Some of the biggest names in UK transport have seen parking revenues increase and their parking assets controlled and managed more 
			efficiently, since contracting out to CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>"Our expertise is car park management. It's all we do and we manage and operate car parks in a wide variety of industry sectors," says CP 
			Plus's, Grahame Rose. "We are particularly excited about working with Welcome Break, as it consolidates our position as market leader in 
			the motorway service area sector."</p>
			
			<p>For Welcome Break, the top priority in choosing CP Plus was to enable them to provide higher levels of customer care. By outsourcing its 
			car park management, Welcome Break is able to concentrate on its core business, while also enhancing its customer offering.</p>
			
			<p>"Before the recent agreement, we managed parking at our motorways service areas in-house, but for us it was very much a secondary 
			activity. CP Plus is clearly an expert in this area and for them it is their primary focus," explains Karen McKechnie, Welcome Break 
			Business Development Director.</p>
			
			<p>"With their knowledge and experience, we believe our car parks will be more professionally managed and run, to the benefit of all our 
			customers. Our research shows that drivers are looking for more from motorway service areas these days. They are more demanding. To meet 
			these growing needs, for example, we have recently invested �100,000 in shower facilities for HGV drivers. "Upgrading the management of 
			parking through this agreement is an integral part of our commitment to providing a continually improving service."</p>
			
			<p>"Although better customer service was the main reason for deciding to work with CP Plus, any financial gain in the future would, of course, 
			be an added bonus for Welcome Break. It is still early in the agreement and improving our customer service remains uppermost in our minds, 
			but hopefully with time we will also see increased revenues," says Karen.</p>
			
			<p>The deal is already paying off in terms of more efficient payment collection and enforcement. "With better management processes in place 
			and a higher profile presence on site, CP Plus is able to ensure that people who park for extended periods do pay and that parking abusers 
			don't monopolise the best spaces all day, inconveniencing our other customers," Karen concludes.</p>
			
			<p>"Our aim is to be sensitive to our customers' needs and meet those needs to the best of our ability. CP Plus is helping us do that."</p>

			<h3 id="news13">Hospitals Bring In Parking Control July 2003</h3>
			
			<p>Two Welsh hospitals are bringing in management controls to ease the pressure on parking problems and provide extra places for staff. 
			Carmarthenshire NHS Trust says the current lack of parking controls and lack of a payment system is leading to congestion and inconvenience 
			to both staff and visitors, which is why they have just awarded a 15 year Public Private Partnership contract to CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>The contract will involve construction of additional spaces and implementation of a management and control system in the car parks at West 
			Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen and Prince Phillip Hospital in Llanelli.</p>
			
			<p>At West Wales General Hospital, an additional 100 spaces for staff will be constructed, bringing the number of staff spaces to 746. 
			Staff parking will be operated with a permit system and the new pay and display system for visitors will accommodate 254 vehicles, bringing 
			the total number in the newly expanded parking areas to 1,000 spaces. At the Prince Phillip Hospital at Llanelli, which has 350 staff and 
			228 visitor parking spaces, similar measures will be put in place to tackle the problem. Highly trained, uniformed staff will be provided 
			on both sites to dramatically improve service efficiency and security at the hospital for staff and visitors. Both sites are scheduled to be 
			fully operational by September 2003.</p>
			
			<p>Carmarthenshire NHS Trust is the latest NHS Trust to work with CP Plus who is the market leader in this sector, operating at over 50
			NHS sites. CP Plus' Head of Development, Grahame Rose believes that the company's success of working within the healthcare sector boils 
			down to understanding the very special needs of hospital trusts and others in the sector. He says: "Each hospital or other healthcare 
			organisation will have different needs and during a series of meetings we will discuss their particular requirements with them to ensure 
			that the tailored programme we construct is ideally suited to their situation."</p>
			
			<p>NHS Trusts often do not have funds available for these types of projects and CP Plus is able help with this by providing funding through 
			PPP/PFI projects, which not only improves the levels of service, without eating into valuable healthcare resources but at the same time 
			can create revenue generation opportunities.</p>
			
			<p>Mansell Bennett from Carmarthenshire NHS Trust said: "We knew that we needed more spaces and that we also had to address the high levels 
			of vehicle turnover and staff parking needs, but also that we couldn't forget that patients and their families are often under stress when 
			visiting the hospitals and need to be treated sympathetically." With their vast experience of delivering a quality car parking service to 
			the NHS, we are confident that CP Plus has the right expertise to provide a parking solution to suit our particular needs."</p>

			<p>Owners of large private car parks on the outskirts of London's Congestion Zone are being forced to take emergency action against 
			'cheating' drivers out to beat the cost of driving into the capital, according to CP Plus, the UK's leading car park management company.</p>
						
			<p>Three months after the �5 a day charge was introduced, evidence shows that major roads leading into the capital are more crowded than 
			ever before as drivers fight to get as close to the centre as they can, before abandoning their vehicles for public transport.</p>
			
			<p>As a result, businesses on the edge of the Zone are having to introduce barriers and parking permits to stop unwanted drivers stealing 
			parking spaces from paying customers.</p>
			
			<p>"We have been approached by a number of businesses and car park owners who are fed up with the 'ditch and ride' mentality that has 
			developed since the charge was introduced," said Grahame Rose, of CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>"These drivers are cheating the system by targeting large unmanaged car parks owned by hotels, supermarkets, leisure centres and other 
			venues because they know they won't be caught. We are even aware of some people who use a different car park for each day of the week to 
			lessen the chance of being spotted.</p>
			
			<p>"Businesses are telling us that this is affecting their own level of customer service and causing concern that genuine customers are 
			being driven away because they can't find a parking space."</p>
			
			<p>A survey just released by Trafficmaster revealed that journey times on 10 out of the 12 major routes into London have increased 
			dramatically since the charge was introduced, with the worst hotspots around Archway, the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth, Acton and the 
			Westway.</p>
			
			<p>At the same time, figures show that an extra 300,000 Londoners are opting for the bus and Rose believes this is further proof that 
			people are driving as far as they can before ditching their cars for the day.</p>
