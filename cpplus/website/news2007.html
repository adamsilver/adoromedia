			<h3 id="news07_08">Top management for seven sites (Jun 2007)</h3>
			
			<p>The second phase of a contract to manage car parking sites within NHS Greater Glasgow 
			and Clyde NHS Board went live on 9 March. The addition of Stobhill and Southern General 
			brings the total number of facilities operated for the Board by car park management 
			specialists CP Plus to seven.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus has been managing parking on the Yorkhill Hospital, Gartnavel General and 
			Gartnavel Royal Hospitals, Western Infirmary, and Victoria Infirmary sites since July 2007.</p>
			
			<p>The Board's new parking policy, which followed a lengthy stakeholder consultation 
			process, was implemented by CP Plus in order to manage traffic more efficiently and 
			consistently, stamping out parking abuse – a particular problem where free parking was 
			available – and freeing up more space on the busy sites for legitimate users.</p>
			
			<p>At the same time, the Board's green strategy was introduced to encourage the use of 
			alternative modes of transport, such as cycling, motorcycling and public transport, as 
			well as car pooling and sharing.</p>
			
			<p>Parking for patients and visitors is on a 'pay and display' basis. In line with recent 
			guidance from the Scottish Government to NHS Boards, the maximum charge in the hospital 
			car parks for staff, patients and visitors has been set at &#163;3 per day.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, an increased number of patients qualify for concessionary parking due to 
			disability or other reasons. NHS staff are able to purchase parking permits at an affordable 
			level for the designated staff car parks.</p>
			
			<p>"The new national guidance on charging will be reflected in the Board's coming review of 
			its parking policy," explained Gavin Povey of CP Plus. "The main aim of the policy remains
			the same, however, to ensure that patients, staff and visitors have priority access to parking 
			on all the hospital sites."</p>

			<h3 id="news07_07">Drawing up a blueprint for more sustainable travel (Jun 2007)</h3>
			<p>For many larger businesses, local authorities, NHS trusts and other organisations, travel can represent the single biggest 
			impact they have on the environment. How can they reduce that impact? The most common mechanism is the introduction of an 
			integrated transport policy, combined with individual site travel plans. Indeed, central government actively encourages major 
			employers to have transport strategies in place; in the case of the NHS they are a requirement.</p>
			<p>Travel plans are blueprints to help organisations assess and simplify their travel and parking needs. They provide a package 
			of practical measures to help reduce the financial and environmental burden of business travel. In the process they can change 
			behaviours, improve travel patterns and reduce the overuse of private cars.</p>
			<p>Unnecessary solo car travel is an obvious target for improvement. The Highways Agency has piloted some feasibility studies, 
			including one on the M42 near Birmingham, aimed at encouraging car sharing by providing special lanes for vehicles containing two 
			or more passengers. High occupancy vehicle (HOV) or car pool lanes are created by either using the hard shoulder or widening roads.  
			Such schemes have proved effective in America and Australia.</p>
			<p>As well as encouraging car sharing, travel plans should include measures to make better use of public transport and develop a 
			more sophisticated approach to parking. All this is in addition to measures to promote alternative methods of travel such as cycling 
			and walking, and to cut the need to travel at all, through innovations such as videoconferencing.</p>
			<p>Travel plans should consist of a range of measures to reduce unnecessary travel and improve the management of necessary travel. 
			Plans need to be based on sound research, including a survey of travel needs at each site. They should also be inclusive, including 
			the views of as many members of staff as possible, at all levels.</p>
			<p>Effective parking management, as part of a travel plan, can be instrumental in creating improved employee relations, making it 
			easier, for example, for employees to arrive at work punctually and less stressed. At its most dramatic, it can even help save 
			lives by eliminating illegal parking that can block emergency exits.</p>
			<p>In advising a client, CP Plus would always tailor a travel plan to the individual circumstances of each site but considerations 
			would typically cover:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cycling facilities, storage and changing rooms/showers</li>
				<li>Improved pedestrian routes</li>
				<li>Improved site signage</li>
				<li>Information on public transport</li>
				<li>Favourable public transport provision</li>
				<li>Priority parking or reduced tariffs for car sharers</li>
				<li>Flexible working practices</li>
				<li>Reduced parking charges and/or parking priority to car sharers</li>
				<li>Parking charges or payment to people who don't park</li>
				<li>Parking restrictions for people who live close by or on public transport routes</li>
				<li>Management techniques such as card entry or permit systems</li>
				<li>Fair but robust parking enforcement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Developing a greener approach to travel has many advantages beyond the important environmental ones.</p>  
			<p>Having a travel plan in place enables organisations to see where they are incurring unnecessary costs and take steps to reduce 
			them. Over-reliance on private cars is an expensive option and a reduction in use will have a positive impact on an organisation's 
			maintenance and fuel costs.</p>
			<p>In addition, improving the travel experience for staff helps them become better motivated, healthier and more productive. By 
			managing parking better, organisations can reduce the demand for spaces or make more efficient use of the ones they have, 
			potentially freeing up expensive land for alternative usage.</p>
			<p>Better managed transport and parking arrangements help organisations fulfil their duty of care towards the workforce. Improved 
			transport arrangements can facilitate more flexible working practices, enabling shift workers whose cars are essential to their 
			work, for example, to have priority parking spaces.</p>
			<p>CP Plus works with local authorities, NHS trusts and leading architects, developers and construction companies on a number of 
			major public sector projects, advising them on travel plans and parking policies as part of its comprehensive range of parking 
			management services.</p>
			<p>As a responsible car park management company, we support and encourage initiatives that lessen the impact of traffic on the 
			environment.  This includes advising its clients on drawing up effective travel plans, as part of their overall transport and 
			parking management strategy. Developing travel plans makes both environmental and business sense, especially as they are 
			increasingly a requirement for securing planning permissions.</p>

			<h3 id="news07_06">Brushing up the image of car parks (May 2007)</h3>
			<p>Shopping centres are becoming more conscious of the image their car parks project to the public.</p>
			<p>Recognising how off-putting a dirty and litter-strewn facility is to shoppers and how crucial first 
			impressions are, a number of shopping centres around the UK are taking advantage of a new, combined parking 
			and facilities management service being offered by car park management specialists, CP Plus.</p>
			<p>Alongside core car park management skills, the new service includes steam cleaning, litter picking, road 
			sweeping and general maintenance, as well as a range of security services.</p>
			<p>"A safe, clean and tidy car park is a huge asset to any shopping centre," said CP Plus's Director of Operations, 
			Ian Langdon. "Many centres are aware of this but until now had to look to multi-agencies for these services and then 
			manage the co-ordination of the various separate services.</p>
			<p>"Since we see a smart, professionally managed and well presented car park as part and parcel of the solutions we 
			offer, it made logical sense for us to put together a comprehensive package of services to help make sure that the car 
			parks we manage always look their best."</p>
			<p>The level of services provided by CP Plus is tailored to the needs of each individual site. "And because our 
			operatives are on the ground working on site, they are on hand to flag up when a site needs to be spruced up, so we 
			can be onto any problems quickly and simply, without the client having to worry about it," added Langdon.</p>
			<p>So far, the CP Plus facilities management service has been rolled out at seven sites throughout the UK, from 
			Borehamwood and Colne Valley Retail Parks in the South East to West Cornwall Retail Park in Hayle.</p>

			<h3 id="news07_05">Full marks for safer parking (May 2007)</h3>
			<p>Edgware Community Hospital in Middlesex is the latest car park facility managed by CP Plus to be awarded the crime-prevention 
			Park Mark award, under the Safer Parking scheme.</p>
			<p>Parking facilities that receive the award have to demonstrate a high degree of capability to deter criminal activity and 
			anti-social behaviour. Although vehicle-related crime has declined by 51% since 1997, there were some 1.7 million vehicle 
			related thefts during 2005-06, according to Home Office figures, with car parks accounting for 14% of the total vehicle-related 
			crime.</p>
			<p>Achieving the prestigious safety mark of approval gives users added reassurance, contributing towards deterring criminal 
			activity and, just as important, reducing the fear of crime, as CP Plus's Grahame Rose explains.</p>  
			<p>"CP Plus took the initiative to work with our clients to upgrade their facilities to the required level to achieve Park Mark 
			status because we believe it helps car park users feel more secure. If patients, visitors, staff and other users know their 
			vehicle is safe, it makes them feel more comfortable about using the facility. We find that having the Park Mark logo displayed 
			on the signage has a positive effect on everyone's confidence."</p>
			<p>Each car park is vetted by independent assessors representing the British Parking Association and the Association of Chief 
			Police Officers (ACPO). Facilities must demonstrate that they are well managed and maintained and have levels of lighting, 
			security and signage that meet the required standards of the scheme.</p>
			<p>"The assessors go into some detail. As well as checking the standard of lighting and CCTV, they look at areas such as 
			perimeter fences, making sure there is no easy route for criminals to make a quick getaway. High quality signage is another 
			factor that is essential to creating a more secure environment."</p>
			<p>Maintenance is another important consideration. Fences, lighting and other security measures must be kept in good condition 
			to be effective. If a problem, such as a broken fence or faulty light, is identified, CP Plus operators on site work side by 
			side with the estate department to ensure it is quickly rectified. Management processes including staff communications systems 
			and Health &amp; Safety procedures must also meet the standards required by the scheme.</p>
			<p>All these criteria, and more, were met by the CP Plus managed sites that have achieved Park Mark status. The most recent 
			award, made to the Edgware Community Hospital in April 2007, recognised the work that had gone in to the design, management 
			and maintenance of the car parks.</p>
			<p>As well as Edgware Hospital, a range of other CP Plus clients' facilities have achieved the Park Mark stamp of approval.</p> 
			<p>Darlington College, one of the largest further education colleges in the North of England, was given the Park Mark award in 
			December 2006. The College moved to a new �35 million campus in August 2006, giving a welcome opportunity to provide on-site, 
			purpose-built parking for its staff and students.</p>
			<p>Hereford County Hospital was awarded the Park Mark award in November 2006. At Hereford, one of the principal challenges was 
			the facility's town centre location. The Trust's three main parking areas are now barrier-controlled and car park attendants are 
			on site during busy periods.</p>
			<p>Diane Weaver of the food and management services company Sodexho, part of the Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust private finance 
			initiative, is happy with the way the new system is working. "We're very pleased with the outcome and delighted the car park 
			has been recognised by the Park Mark award," she said.</p>
			<p>Airedale General Hospital was the first in the North East to receive a 'whole site' award, renewed in August 2006 for a further 
			two years. Airdale's award came thanks in part to the introduction of improved lighting and CCTV systems. For added reassurance, 
			CP Plus also installed public help points and new signage and began regular site security patrols. These measures had a dramatic 
			effect. The West Yorkshire hospital has more than 2,000 car parking spaces. Despite this huge volume, only three crimes were 
			reported over a period of 12 months.</p>
			<p>Technology was in the forefront when improvements were made to the parking facilities at the Royal Brompton to enable the 
			hospital to be awarded the Park Mark certificate in September 2006. As well as upgrading the hospital's CCTV system so it covered 
			all car park areas and improving the barrier system to offer higher levels of security, CP Plus installed the latest in Automatic 
			Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) software.</p>
			<p>"We are enthusiastic supporters of the Safer Parking scheme," Rose concludes. "Our goal, which we are working hard towards, is 
			to have all our clients' sites in the road, rail, NHS and retail sectors awarded this safety seal of approval. Crime prevention 
			and public reassurance are two of our highest priorities."</p>

			<h3 id="news07_04">Improving parking services to maximise revenue streams (May 2007)</h3>
			<p>Like all other businesses, Britain's train operating companies (TOCs) are concerned about keeping their customers happy. The 
			provision of convenient, efficient and well managed parking facilities is a very important factor in enhancing the travel 
			experience and encouraging customers to use train services more frequently.</p>
			<p>Improving parking facilities means not only upgrading the infrastructure and exploiting new technology to the full, it means 
			where necessary providing trained operators on the ground.</p>
			<h4>Payment technology</h4>
			<p>There's not doubt that advances in payment technology are helping to drive forward the transformation of rail parking and 
			parking management in this country.</p>
			<p>Various cashless payment systems - like credit card and, more recently, pay-by-phone technologies - are on the increase. 
			More and more TOCs are recognising that it is no longer efficient or reasonable to expect motorists to carry around pocketfuls 
			of change to feed into pay machines.</p>
			<p>M-payment systems are proving popular wherever they are installed, from Edinburgh to London. Users like their flexibility 
			and convenience, parking management companies like the increased levels of compliance control they give. With one mobile phone 
			call, users can pay for parking, using a debit or credit card. In pay &amp; display car parks, they can even sign up for text messages 
			to remind them when their ticket payment expires. The various pay-by-phone schemes improve management standards by giving parking 
			assistants a more hi-tech way of verifying payment. They can check if payment has been made either via traditional 'print and display' 
			tickets, or by using a WAP-enabled phone or other display, which shows the registration numbers of pre-paid cars.</p>
			<h4>Safe and secure</h4>
			<p>Station car parks should be safe, secure and welcoming - combating the fear of crime, as well as criminal activity itself. 
			This means providing high levels of security and good standards of lighting, landscaping and signage.</p>
			<p>When customers arrive back at the rail station, they want to feel comfortable and protected - they also want to find their car 
			and any valuables untouched and unharmed. Unlike other car parks, station facilities are often unused for most of the day, apart 
			from during the morning and evening commuter rush. Cars may therefore be left unattended for eight or more hours at a time, with 
			few passers-by around to report any instances of vandalism and theft. That's why TOCs are increasingly employing the latest in CCTV 
			technology.</p>
			<p>However, CCTV is only as good as the response times to an incident; it's no good being able to view someone attempting to break 
			into a vehicle if you can't respond quickly enough to prevent the crime. Systems linked to a remote central control room can suffer 
			from this if there are not staff able to respond - being able to 'warn off' criminals remotely through a PA system is also only 
			effective if sometimes there is a back up response.</p>
			<p>Security measures don't have to be hi-tech, however. Alongside the technology, companies should also pay attention to details 
			such as perimeter fences and signage. Well maintained fencing and clear signage will discourage crime and reassure travellers. And 
			it's important to keep the personal touch. On site patrols, particularly after dark, can be very effective and provide that reponse. 
			Highly trained, highly visible staff can be every bit as important as the latest in security technology.</p>
			<h4>Compliance and enforcement</h4>
			<p>The personal touch is important in enforcement too. The presence of parking assistants gives reassurance to the travelling 
			public; they can help with enquiries, nip potential problems in the bud, and at the same time discourage parking abusers and 
			ensure that regulations are enforced.</p>
			<p>Every TOC wants to make sure that the travelling public come first when it comes to parking. Parking facilities should be 
			available to genuine rail customers, not used - or abused - by shoppers or local business people not taking a train.</p>		
			<p>The trick is not to alienate a bona fide parking customer, who is maybe running late for his or her train and hasn't got time 
			to pay, while putting off habitual rogue parkers who have no intention of paying. The aim should be to ensure there is minimal 
			non-rail use of facilities, freeing up more space for train customers.</p>
			<p>Some TOCs favour a dual tariff which prices non-travelling motorists out of their rail car parks and pay on foot systems offer 
			a  flexible system for travellers, allowing them to pay when they collect their cars.. Care should also be taken to reward good 
			customers, like premium payers and season ticket holders, with perks such as special parking bays and priority parking close to 
			the station entrance.</p>
			<p>Drop off and pick up points are notoriously difficult to police. Here again, manned patrols can serve as a preventative measure, 
			especially when coupled with temporary CCTV or digital cameras for particular blackspots.</p>
			<h4>South West Trains</h4> 
			<p>South West Trains has achieved considerable success in improving the levels of payment compliance in its 90-plus station pay 
			&amp; display car parks, through better enforcement.</p>
			<p>In place of widespread abuse, an independent survey showed the TOC now achieves a remarkable payment compliance rate of 99.7%. 
			At the same time, the number of customer complaints about enforcement has been reduced from hundreds per month to practically zero.</p>
			<p>This remarkable turnaround was achieved by introducing a staged enforcement policy. Parking abusers at their stations are issued 
			with warning notices, then charge notices, and persistent offenders are only clamped as a last resort.</p>
			<p>By operating a system that is based on encouraging parking abusers not to re-offend, rather than focusing primarily on punishment 
			and penalties, South West Trains is able to combine firmness with fairness, keeping everyone happy.</p> 
			<h4>Operational best practice</h4>
			<p>Better managed parking can help improve traffic flows, as well as alleviate bottlenecks. However, managing the fluctuating 
			volumes of traffic that many stations experience at busy entry and exit times takes organisation, plus a carefully chosen portfolio 
			of management practises, equipment and services, tailored to each site and its requirements, and regularly updated to meet 
			constantly changing needs.</p> 
			<p>It's right that the travelling public should make tough demands on our rail companies. Improving parking facilities, providing 
			efficient parking management and using the latest that technology can offer are all sure-fire ways of improving the service and 
			achieving better levels of customer satisfaction - leading inevitably to a positive effect on revenues.</p>

			<h3 id="news07_03">Health check for secure parking (Mar 2007)</h3>
			<p>NHS Trust managers have the demanding task of looking after the interests of patients, visitors and healthcare professionals, 
			who understandably want secure parking when they come to work, says Grahame Rose of car park management company, CP Plus.</p>
			<p>When looking at car park security measures, how do you decide which is best? Should you choose CCTV, with or without live 
			monitoring, staff employed around the clock or only at peak times? Whatever the system, it should allow the car parks to 
			achieve the Park Mark Safer Parking Award.</p>
			<p>There is an array of systems and measures which can be adopted, says Rose.  The way to decide which system is best for a 
			particular hospital is to undertake a comprehensive survey and audit; no decisions should be made until this has been carried out.</p> 
			<p>Each site and Trust will have different requirements, says Rose, and it is therefore important to tailor the parking scheme to 
			suit each site's and client's particular needs. With this in mind, some Trusts put their car parking into the hands of professional 
			management and security companies, rather than manage their own sites.</p>
			<p>As one of the first management companies to work in the NHS sector, CP Plus has, over the years, seen  overall standards 
			improve and the reluctance to go with outside contractors is becoming a thing of the past, especially with the coming requirement 
			for Car Park staff to be SIA licensed. Trusts no longer see their car parks as a piece of tarmac, says Rose, but an important 
			resource to be used in an efficient manner. Outsourcing the management of their car parks, as with other services such as catering, 
			allows the Trust to concentrate on its primary task - healthcare.</p>
			<p>To the parking industry, the advantages of working with a professional management and security company are obvious. Highly 
			trained staff can ensure the smooth running of a site and where there is a dual parking and security service, professionally 
			trained staff in the two disciplines will create advantageous synergies and be far more cost effective than two separate teams.</p>
			<p>CP Plus is the UK's number one parking service provider to the NHS, managing and controlling over 50 NHS sites across the UK.</p>

			<h3 id="news07_02">CP Plus brings order to shopping centre parking (Feb 2007)</h3>
			<p>Car park management company, CP Plus, has been awarded a contract to manage five shopping centre sites for Munroe K Asset

			five developments combined with Facilities Management and CCTV Monitoring.</p>
			<p>The five centres are Borehamwood Retail Park, Borehamwood, Prospect Place Retail Park, Dartford, Waterfields Retail Park,

			<h3 id="news07_01">Right on track for zero car park complaints (Jan 2007)</h3>
			<p>For many train operating companies, parking enforcement is as much about offering customers a service that is efficient, secure 
			and fair as it is about protecting revenue streams . Nothing annoys the parking public more than over-zealous or inconsistent 
			enforcement regimes.</p>
			<p>When South West Trains awarded the parking contract for its 93 stations to car park management company, CP Plus, it was within 
			the context of a previous enforcement regime that had generated significant numbers of complaints. Naturally, this state of affairs 
			did nothing for the South West Trains' good relationship with its customers.</p>
			<p>CP Plus' winning of the South West Trains contract marked the start of a different approach to both enforcement and revenue 
			protection, with immediate results.</p>
			<p>"Complaints from passengers about enforcement are now negligible, unlike before when we only clamped," explains Jo Shelley, 
			Head of Retail Services, South West Trains. "Compliance to ticket purchase is good and has been unaffected by a more 
			customer-focused, three-stage approach to car park enforcement."</p>		
			<p>The most obvious result of the change was a dramatic drop in complaints. "A bonus and abatement regime within our agreement 
			allows for one justified complaint per four-week period. But in reality we get nowhere near that number now," explains Shelley. 
			"The same regime sets out compliance to the number of station visits, response time to customer complaints and the time to release 
			wheel clamps. All these are linked to customer service and designed to ensure we provide a fair and efficient car park enforcement 
			service."</p>
			<p>A three-pronged approach to enforcement is key to this success. South West Trains and CP Plus introduced the STEP (STaged 
			Enforcement Policy) system, under which parking abusers are issued with warning notices and then charge notices, and are only 
			clamped as a last resort. By operating a system that is based on encouraging parking abusers not to re-offend, rather than 
			focusing primarily on punishment and penalties, the STEP system is able to combine firmness with fairness, keeping everyone 
			happy.</p>
			<p>"Working with CP Plus to adopt a more customer-focused approach, we have been able not only to improve our levels of customer 
			satisfaction, but also save ourselves a lot of time in dealing with complaints," she says. "This has freed up staff to take on 
			other duties, while still protecting our revenue streams. And, contrary to what we anticipated, compliance to ticket purchase 
			has not worsened as a result of having a fairer enforcement regime, so revenues haven't suffered."</p>
			<p>The contract with South West Trains also includes mobile operators visiting the sites on a rota basis. "Apart from enforcement, 
			one of the other benefits is the improved perception of security our passengers now have, because of the company patrols in our 
			car parks," says Shelley.</p>
