			<h3>Car Parking Enforcement</h3>
			<p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue; that is why CP Plus operates an individually agreed policy 
			for each client, as well as for each site managed. 
			<a class="readMore" href="car-parking-enforcement.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--
			<p>The STEP (STaged Enforcement Policy) was devised by us to provide a phased approach. Enforcement 
			measures are tailored to suit each client and specific circumstance. Using STEP, levels of 
			enforcement are introduced in a manner and at a pace that is appropriate for every client and each 
			location.</p>
			<p>When it comes to parking enforcement issues, we emphasise the positive. We prefer to work through 
			encouragement and prevention, identifying parking abusers and persuading them through a range of 
			strategies not to re-offend, rather than primarily focusing on punishment and penalties.</p>
			<p>However, if robust enforcement is required, for instance to protect customers' interests or 
			safeguard clients' revenue streams, then we have the processes and the people in place to act 
			decisively.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car Parking Management &amp; PFI/PPP</h3>
			<h4>What are PFI and PPP?</h4>
			<p>A Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is a form of Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP is a generic 
			term. It is used to describe a wide range of activities, including informal strategic partnerships and 
			formal joint ventures, in which the public and private sectors work together, with varying levels of 
			involvement and responsibility. 
			<a class="readMore" href="car-parking-management.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>A PFI typically involves a more formal, long-term service contract between a public sector body and 
			a private sector operator, often with support from central Government.</p>
			<h4>How is CP Plus involved?</h4>
			<p>CP Plus is working with a number of public sector organisations on both substantial and smaller 
			PFI/PPP projects. On large projects, we can be a sole provider or a partner in a wider consortium.</p>
			<p>We've been able to provide funding through this route for the provision of multi-storey car parks, 
			car park refurbishment, control rooms, CCTV systems, pay equipment, barriers, pay and display systems 
			and parking management.</p>
			<p>Thanks to such PFI/PPP ventures, our public sector clients are able to provide contemporary, 
			value-for-money car park facilities of which they can be proud.</p>
			<p>Please click below to read our white paper discussing issues surrounding PFI and PPP. If you need 
			the Adobe Acrobat reader please click below for the free download.</p>

			<h3>Car Parking &amp; Security</h3>
			<p>We regard safety and security as some of our key priorities.</p>
			<p>Well-trained and visible staff are a powerful crime deterrent. Our on site staff and our Area 
			Managers make regular monitoring and control checks at our sites and our management and site procedures 
			are approved for the Park Mark Safer Parking Award by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
			<a class="readMore" href="car-parking-security.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>All staff receive training to NVQ and Security Industry Training Organisation (SITO) standards, as 
			well as specialist training such as aggression handling. Where required, staff will be SIA licensed.</p>
			<p>As an ISO 9001:2000 registered company, we are fully compliant with BS7499 and BS7858 manned guarding 
			and vetting procedures.</p>
			<p>In every location managed by us, we have achieved reduced levels of car crime and significantly 
			improved car park security. We recognise that safe and secure parking facilities enhance the whole 
			community, bringing benefits far beyond the obvious.</p>
			<p>Our robust security procedures form an integral part of our car park management and mobile patrol 
			services. At all times our trained staff remain in contact and are on hand to respond rapidly to any 
			situation. We can provide integrated internal and external security systems, and we employ the latest 
			that new technology can offer in terms of CCTV, vehicle logging and tracking, and other advanced security 
			systems.</p>-->
			
			<h3>Car Parking Technology</h3>
			<p>CP Plus utilises the latest technology to ensure that our clients and their customers benefit from 
			a superior parking experience. Our in-house developed and designed permit management, patrol logging 
			and vehicle tracking systems provide our clients with the most advanced technology available.
			<a class="readMore" href="car-parking-technology.html" title="Read more...">Read more...</a></p>
			<!--<p>Staff use the latest handheld computer technology to support parking enforcement processes and as 
			part of our permit system. State-of-the-art technologies, such as mobile phone and Internet-based 
			payment systems and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), are also incorporated in the portfolio 
			of services we offer.</p>
			<p>We use technology where there is a proven need and where it adds real value to the services on offer 
			- not because it's the latest thing. We never underestimate the simple approach. Where the situation 
			demands it, we employ uncomplicated, traditional systems - in fact we utilise whatever is needed to 
			ensure that our client receives the very highest Car Park Management service.</p>-->

			<!--<h3>Accreditations</h3>
			<p>CP Plus is committed to raising the levels of professionalism within the parking management 
			and security industry sector. 
			<a class="readMore" href="accreditations.html" title="Read more">Read more...</a></p>-->
			<!--<p>CP Plus is the first car park management company in the UK to be recognised with a quality 
			mark for its security standards. Following a rigorous assessment procedure, CP Plus has achieved 
			Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS) status from the Security Industry Authority (SIA).</p>
			<p>We are accredited to the international Quality Standard, ISO 9001:2000 and NSI Guarding Gold - 
			the highest gold standard award for Manned Guarding from the National Security Inspectorate.</p>
			<p>CP Plus invests heavily in its staff and has achieved Investors in People status; this is the 
			National Standard that sets a level of good practice for improving an organisation's performance 
			through its employees and demonstrates a company's continued commitment to their staff.</p>
			<p>A comprehensive training programme is key to achieving this aim. Our 400 staff based throughout 
			the UK receive ongoing training and are continually assessed. As a responsible company, we comply 
			with the provisions of BS7858 security screening, which includes the vetting of staff.</p>
			<p>Over 100 CP Plus staff have been licensed by the SIA for Manned Guarding, CCTV Monitoring and 
			Vehicle Immobilisation.</p>-->
