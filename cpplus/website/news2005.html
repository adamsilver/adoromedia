			<h3 id="news01">Where The Commuter Is King (July 2005)</h3>
			
			<p>Train operating companies face the same challenges as other organisations who provide multi-site 
			car park facilities - only more so," said Grahame Rose, Business Development Director at CP Plus. 
			"For them, as with most businesses, the top priority is keeping their customers happy."</p>
			
			<p>When commuters arrive at the station in the morning, they want fast, efficient, no fuss payment 
			and parking. When they return at night, they want to find their vehicles safe and be able to leave 
			with the minimum of delay.</p>

			<p>To enable this to happen, high volumes of traffic have to be managed efficiently within very short 
			timeframes. Unlike, for example, town centre car parks, most traffic at rail stations is tidal; the 
			great majority of cars arrive at the same time in the morning and leave at the same time in the 
			afternoon.</p>
			
			<p>As well as daily fluctuations in traffic volume, there may be seasonal ones to contend with. The 
			area served by one of CP Plus's rail clients, Wessex Trains, for example, includes a number of 
			stations in the holiday regions of Devon and Cornwall. Traffic volumes at Wessex's stations can 
			be up to 20 times higher at certain times of the year.</p>
			
			<p>Managing variable volumes of traffic at constrained entry and exit times takes a well-oiled 
			operation, well-chosen equipment, well-thought out systems and well-organised staff. CP Plus 
			works with each rail client to provide a portfolio of appropriate products and services, suited 
			to each client and each site.</p>
			
			<p>Putting the travelling customer first is obviously the top priority. All train operating companies 
			want to ensure their parking facilities are available to rail customers, not used as a source of 
			cheap and convenient parking by shoppers or local business people.</p>
			
			<p>Imposing the right style of enforcement is critical to achieving this aim. Grahame Rose said: "We 
			would always advise train operating company clients to go for customer-friendly enforcement - not 
			penalising genuine customers, while at the same time ensuring abusers don't get away with it. This 
			means taking into account the circumstances of each incident and planning for common eventualities.</p>
			
			<p>"Ideally, we strive to ensure there is minimal non-rail use of our clients' parking facilities - 
			so there is always space available for travelling customers.</p>
			
			<p>"As we prefer persuasion over penalties, we recommend operating a dual tariff system, in effect 
			pricing non-rail customers out of rail car parks and moving them on to town centre facilities
			instead."</p>
			
			<p>The idea is to target habitual and deliberate parking abusers, while allowing for regular commuters, 
			who make the occasional mistake, to be treated with understanding and sensitivity.</p>
			
			<p>"We certainly would not recommend coming down hard on a genuine commuter who fails to pay one morning 
			because he or she is late for a train. Instead we have introduced flexible systems at rail stations, 
			whereby customers can pay later in the day or when they collect their car."</p>
			
			<p>In addition, CP Plus advocates special treatment to good customers. For example, special parking bays 
			and priority parking close to the station entrance, for premium payers and season ticket holders.</p>
			
			<p>Many stations operate short-term 'pick up and drop off' points, which can be a headache and need to 
			be vigorously policed throughout the day, if they are not to be abused.</p>
			
			<p>Commuter usage also has implications for security. Unlike other kinds of car parks, station 
			facilities are unused for most of the day. Cars are sometimes left unattended for ten or more 
			hours at a time, where there are few passers-by to be aware of any vandalism and theft that may 
			occur.</p>
			
			<p>To increase security and deter criminal activity, security at rail car parks needs to be particularly 
			efficient and high-profile. Highly visible staff is still one of the most effective deterrents. CP 
			Plus operates regular patrols throughout the day, backed up by CCTV and a rapid response system.</p>
			
			<p>There are no general rules about running an efficient rail parking facility. "As in any other sector, 
			every company is different and every car park is different. We assess each one individually and 
			recommend investment, or indeed provide it, accordingly," said Grahame Rose.</p>
			
			<p>"The main thing to remember is that this is a highly customer-focused sector in which the needs of 
			the customer, as always, must come first."</p>

			<h3 id="news02">Parking Professionals To The Rescue (June 2005)</h3>
			<p>Parking at most hospitals and Healthcare Trusts is at an absolute premium and it is likely to be some 
			time before this situation improves.</p>
			
			<p>Yet while the Government pushes for successful hospitals to expand their services, when Trusts apply 
			to Local Authorities for planning permission for more spaces, their request is turned down on the 
			basis that they will generate too much traffic, says a frustrated Grahame Rose at car park management 
			company CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>And the fact remains that as a hospital becomes more successful, the more people want to be treated 
			there and Trusts could face the problem of increasingly overcrowded, inefficient car parking for 
			patients, visitors and staff.</p>
			
			<p>There are so many issues which face Trusts when it comes to parking and this is why a Trust should 
			look to professional advice, says Rose, hospitals should be looking after people, not car parks.</p>
			
			<p>Before installing any equipment or security systemS, there are a raft of questions to be considered, 
			for instance, what is the throughput of traffic, is the signage clear, are barriers the right 
			solution, what are the best payment and security options?</p>
			
			<p>Each site will have different requirements, says Rose, and it is therefore important to tailor the 
			parking scheme to suit each site's particular needs.</p>
			
			<p>As one of the first management companies to work in the NHS sector, CP Plus has started to see overall 
			standards improve and the reluctance to go with outside contractors is becoming a thing of the past. 
			Trusts no longer see their car parks as a piece of tarmac, says Rose, but an important resource to be 
			used in an efficient manner.</p>

			<h3 id="news03">Parking Abuse On The Increase (March 2005)</h3>
			
			<p>Retailers are fed up with inconsiderate motorists who make use of their free parking facilities and 
			then don't spend any money in their stores, according to the car park management company CP Plus.</p>
			
			<p>"With free customer parking at such a premium, it is extremely annoying when shopping centres, retail 
			parks and factory outlets find their free spaces are being abused by rogue parkers, often local workers 
			or customers to other stores - and it's a problem that's getting worse," says CP Plus's Grahame Rose.</p>
			
			<p>"There's been a big increase in recent years. We get calls every week from retailers of all kinds 
			desperate for help in combating this kind of parking abuse. For them, every parking space that's 
			blocked by a non-spending customer is a wasted revenue opportunity."</p>
			
			<p>It's not only free parking that is affected. The abuse of disabled parking is also widespread and 
			increasing. A survey by the campaign group Baywatch revealed that more than one in five disabled 
			parking bays in supermarkets is being used by a non-disabled driver.</p>
			
			<p>Properly managed parking is an important part of the whole retail experience; it's the first 
			impression that customers get. Improving customer satisfaction and encouraging shoppers to visit 
			more often, stay longer and remain loyal are top of the hit list for any retailer - that's why it 
			is critical that retailers come down hard on persistent offenders.</p>
			
			<p>It's a complex problem that has no 'magic bullet' answer. "We suggest a range of solutions," 
			says Rose, "depending on the site, the local conditions and the type of abuse they are experiencing. 
			Each solution, or combination of solutions, has to be tailored to the circumstances."</p>
			
			<p>Deterrents can vary from simple measures, such as using windscreen flyers and clear signage and 
			putting uniformed parking officers on site, to more elaborate steps, such as using technology like 
			CCTV and number recognition equipment to identify persistent abusers.</p>
			
			<p>Sensibly applied enforcement is a solution that, surprisingly, most shoppers favour, says Rose. 
			"It's only the abusers who get upset because we've taken away their free parking. The majority of 
			genuine customers accept it as fair and reasonable and are happy that we have freed up space enabling 
			them to park easily and quickly."</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus favours a staged enforcement policy. Using this approach, the level of enforcement is 
			gradually increased over a period of time, from a polite warning note to an eventual penalty. 
			This has the effect of minimising abuse without antagonising the majority of legitimate parking 
			customers.</p>
