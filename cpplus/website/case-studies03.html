			<h2>South West Trains: End of the line for car park complaints</h2>
			<p>For many organisations, parking enforcement isn't so much about maximising revenue 
			streams as offering customers a service that is efficient, secure and - most important - 
			fair. Almost nothing annoys the parking public more than over-zealous or inconsistent 
			enforcement regimes.</p>
			
			<p>When South West Trains awarded the parking contract for its 93 stations to CP Plus, 
			it was within the context of a previous enforcement regime that had generated significant 
			numbers of complaints. Naturally, this state of affairs did nothing for the South West 
			Trains' good relationship with its customers.</p>
			
			<p>CP Plus' winning of the South West Trains contract marked the start of a different 
			approach to both enforcement and revenue protection, with immediate results.</p>
			
			<p>"Complaints from passengers about enforcement are now negligible, unlike before when 
			we only clamped," explains Jo Shelley, Head of Retail Services, South West Trains. "Compliance 
			to ticket purchase is good and has been unaffected by a more customer-focused, three-stage 
			approach to car park enforcement."</p>
			
			<p>The most obvious result of the change was a dramatic drop in complaints. "A bonus and 
			abatement regime within our agreement allows for one justified complaint per four-week period. 
			But in reality we get nowhere near that number now," explains Shelley. "The same regime sets 
			out compliance to the number of station visits, response time to customer complaints and the 
			time to release wheel clamps. All these are linked to customer service and designed to ensure 
			we provide a fair and efficient car park enforcement service."</p>
			
			<p>A three-pronged approach to enforcement is key to this success. South West Trains and CP 
			Plus introduced the STEP (STaged Enforcement Policy) system, under which parking abusers are 
			issued with warning notices and then charge notices, and are only clamped as a last resort. By 
			operating a system that is based on encouraging parking abusers not to re-offend, rather than 
			focusing primarily on punishment and penalties, the STEP system is able to combine firmness 
			with fairness, keeping everyone happy.</p>
			
			<p>"Working with CP Plus to adopt a more customer-focused approach, we have been able not only 
			to improve our levels of customer satisfaction, but also save ourselves a lot of time in dealing 
			with complaints," she says. "This has freed up staff to take on other duties, while still 
			protecting our revenue streams. And, contrary to what we anticipated, compliance to ticket 
			purchase has not worsened as a result of having a fairer enforcement regime, so revenues haven't 
			suffered."</p>
			
			<p>The contract with South West Trains also includes mobile operators visiting the sites on a 
			rota basis. "Apart from enforcement, one of the other benefits is the improved perception of 
			security our passengers now have, because of the company patrols in our car parks," says Shelley.</p>
			
			<p>The partnership has worked well and the initial one-year contract with South West Trains has now 
			been extended. Summing up, Shelley comments, "CP Plus secured the contract for a second year, based 
			on their performance in year one. We've found them to be professional and responsive to requests for 
			changes. They clearly know a lot about parking enforcement."</p>
